00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.540
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:08.570
Today, I'm going to explain a sci-fi and fantasy
show called "Love, Death &amp; Robots: Ice Age.”

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.850
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.430
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.140
A young couple moves into their new apartment.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.850
As Rob, the husband, brings a few boxes up
into the place, his wife, Gail, tells him

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.960
about a funky old refrigerator in the corner
that the landlord left behind.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.420
Rob finds it fascinating, noting how the motor
is above instead of underneath like refrigerators

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.420
these days.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.179
Since hot air rises, he comments that it doesn’t
make sense to put the motor underneath, allowing

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:38.479
the hot air it produces to go up the refrigerator.

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:43.390
However, Gail barely pays attention, and she
simply agrees to the things Rob says.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.699
She then brings out a bottle of wine and asks
her husband if he wants to drink.

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.629
Rob gets excited and opens the old fridge
to get some ice.

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.309
However, the freezer is bulked up with frost,
but he still manages to get a little cube

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:56.309
of ice.

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.769
The couple then makes a short toast to their
new life together.

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.600
Before Rob could take a sip of his drink,
he notices something inside the ice.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.850
He takes it out of the glass and shows it
to Gail, asking her to confirm what’s inside

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.100
the ice cube.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.540
Gail looks closer and becomes just as surprised
as her husband.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.369
Wanting to confirm what she saw, Gail grabs
a magnifying glass to inspect the ice cube

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.369
closely.

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.150
Surprisingly, inside it is a miniature mammoth
with spears in its body.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.670
Gail wonders if there are more of these things
in the freezer, so she opens it.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.650
She quickly takes out the junk inside and
gets shocked by what she sees.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.540
With this, Rob takes a peek and comments there's
a lost civilization in their refrigerator.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.850
True enough, the freezer contains a miniature,
working medieval city.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.090
Everything inside moves so fast, with the
little people going through their day normally,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.179
unaffected by the two giants hovering near
their city.

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.030
In disbelief, Gail claims that what’s happening
doesn’t make sense, and Rob agrees.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.280
She then clarifies that they're seeing an
early medieval city when woolly mammoths died

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.090
out sometime in the late Neolithic period.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.840
Rob shrugs it off and simply agrees with his
wife to hide his ignorance.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.549
Later on, Rob buries the frozen mammoth in
a pot of dirt.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.550
Rob seems sad about it, so Gail lightens up
the mood and says that it'll probably make

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.050
for a good fertilizer.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.540
Curiosity takes over, and the two check the
freezer again.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.780
To their surprise, everything has changed
drastically.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.700
What used to be a medieval city is now a modernized
place during the Industrial Revolution.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.760
Factories and railroads are built, covering
the freezer’s sky with smoke.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.680
The couple notes that they’ve only been
gone for ten minutes, but decades have already

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.700
gone by for the miniature people.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.170
With this, Gail theorizes that time moves
differently inside the freezer.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.291
As they witness the Industrial Revolution
at great speed, Rob is disappointed that they

00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:42.940
missed the Renaissance period.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.150
He notices two miniature men sitting by a
building under construction and wonders if

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.130
the people perceive them as gods.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.700
However, the men are actually making fun of
them, seeing them as weird faces in the sky

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.340
that are staring at the city.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.580
One man even comments that he's tired of seeing
the broccoli that's stuck in Gail's teeth.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.410
Seconds later, modernized buildings are erected.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.590
Rob notices things flying around, and Gail
identifies them as airplanes.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.330
As more skyscrapers are built, Gail believes
that the miniature people have reached the

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.520
present time.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.780
Rob confirms this when he sees a Starbucks
store and comments that the cafe really pops

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.060
out everywhere.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.780
Just then, he notices something weird, so
he takes a closer look.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.810
Suddenly, a missile falls into the middle
of the city and explodes.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.520
The explosion blinds Rob, making him back
away and fall onto the floor.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.390
Gail helps him up and tells him to calm down,
but Rob panics, exclaiming that tactical nukes

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.250
are exploding in their freezer.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.500
However, Rob's face is as red as a tomato,
and Gail could barely keep a straight face.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.690
As the freezer explodes with huge nuclear
bombs, Gail hands a shiny toaster to her husband,

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.840
letting him see how the heat from the explosion
caused his face to glow red.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.270
Rob groans, but then he notices that the situation
in the freezer just became worse.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.450
The couple stares at it as they hear screams,
gunshots, and explosions.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.930
With this, Gail closes the freezer and says
that the people can't possibly outgrow war

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.450
in a couple of minutes.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.530
Hearing this, Rob asks what they should do,
and Gail responds that they should order pizza.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.640
Later that night, the couple has pizza for
dinner while they wait for the situation to

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.640
die down.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.410
An hour has passed, and Rob recommends that
they should check out the freezer.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.970
He hopes that the miniature people had a chance
to rebuild their city, but Gail gently tells

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.360
him that they need to embrace the possibility
that they didn't make it.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.910
Still, Rob goes to the freezer and opens it
anyway.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.760
To their surprise, the freezer glows with
luminous cities and flying cars.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.940
Gail claims that it looks like the Emerald
City, but with less emerald and more futuristic

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:39.940
devices.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.920
The sight of this makes Rob ecstatic, marveling
at how beautiful everything is.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.980
Suddenly, a building emerges right in front
of them, and Rob jokes that it looks like

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.400
an adult toy.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.550
Just then, everything escalates, and a massive
pyramid appears in the middle of the futuristic

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.550
city.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.650
It glows brightly and consumes power from
the bridges attached to it.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.800
Eventually, it turns into a diamond-shaped
fortress and consumes the whole city until

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.750
it bursts into a ball of energy.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.280
The majestic energy explodes like a star,
and streaks of light begin to zoom around

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.530
Rob and Gail's kitchen, filling their apartment
with light.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.930
The wondrous light fascinates them both.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.120
During this period, it seems like the miniature
people have figured out the secrets to time

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.510
and space travel.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:26.030
After this, the streaks of light return to
the freezer, gather into a sphere, and disappear.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.210
This wipes out the smiles on Rob's and Gail's
faces, confused at what they just witnessed.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.770
Rob wonders if the miniature people will ever
return, but Gail thinks it's unlikely.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.960
Because of this, Rob mournfully pulls the
refrigerator's plug as if he’s accepting

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.270
that those tiny people will never return.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.230
Knowing that Rob has grown fond of the miniature
people, Gail hugs him in comfort.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.420
She then closes the freezer, deciding to call
it a day.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.370
The next day, Rob pours their cups of coffee
and hands one to Gail.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.930
Without saying a word to each other, both
wonder about the miniature civilization in

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.980
their freezer.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.900
With the slightest bit of hope that the miniature
people are still alive, they open the freezer

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.840
again to find cold mist pouring out despite
it being unplugged.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.200
Inside, they witness another ice age where
primitive sapiens consume the carcass of a

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.700
mighty brachiosaurus.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.810
It seems like life in the freezer has restarted,
and it has now returned to the age of the

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.020
dinosaurs.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.930
Just then, a roar alerts the sapiens of the
arriving Tyrannosaurus-Rex.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.020
The sapiens run as one is caught between the
dinosaur’s teeth.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.370
The last sapiens tumbles with the T-Rex closing
in, lunging for the kill.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.770
Many claims that the freezer is like a "pocket
universe" that shows how life evolves to the

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.580
point of leaving reality.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.139
Some may think that the freezer showed the
end of their world, but it could also mean

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:41.040
that the miniature humans found a different
dimension to live in.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.560
It’s uncertain how many times this process
of life occurred in the old freezer or if

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.570
it always plays out the same way.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.800
The previous owners may have seen life bloom
and die repeatedly, eventually getting bored

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.940
of it, thus leaving the extraordinary freezer
behind.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.389
Although the show never revealed who created
life inside the freezer, an episode titled

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:02.370
"God: Serengeti" by Oats Studios might just
suggest who did.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.940
A herd of elephants travels across a field,
but their field is on a table in the middle

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.710
of a mysterious man’s study.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.419
The old man doesn’t pay attention to this,
as he’s busy reading a book.

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:17.320
His butler, Geoffrey, asks how the book is,
and the man comments that it’s too technical,

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.130
adding that he prefers chaos.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.450
Still, he likes a recipe for a black hole
from the book.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.820
He turns his attention to the little beings
in his pocket world and laughs at a miniature

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.960
man who’s rubbing two sticks together.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.980
Suddenly, the Homosapien discovers how to
make fire, and the old man is enraged.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.699
He complains that he didn’t say those people
could do such a thing because he’s supposed

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:38.820
to give fire.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:43.310
Geoffrey notes that the current time period
is over 200,000 years before they’re supposed

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.720
to give them fire.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.350
Because of this, the old man orders Geoffrey
to put the fire out, so the butler blows onto

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.449
the table, creating the wind that snuffs out
the flames.

00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:57.530
Still, the old man is pissed, so he tells
Geoffrey to put them back into their caves.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:02.460
The butler obeys, so he triggers the elephants
to stampede towards the humans, forcing them

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.460
to hide.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.850
After it’s done, the old man is still annoyed
at what just happened, so he plans to shrink

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.270
the brains of the tiny beings to prevent them
from making their own choices.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:16.130
Not long after, the homo-sapiens exit the
cave again to perform a rain dance.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.800
Geoffrey reminds him that they haven’t turned
off the drought, so the old man orders him

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.270
to spray some water on the parched little
things.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.490
Geoffrey happily obliges and sprays water
over the table, causing it to rain on the

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:27.490
field.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.030
He comments that their God is merciful as
the homo-sapiens rejoice.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.149
The old man giggles at the sight of their
excitement, so he orders his trusty butler

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:36.740
to spray more water.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.529
As Geoffrey does so, new plants begin to sprout
from the little field.

00:08:40.529 --> 00:08:44.660
Finally, he's had enough of this fun, and
the old man tells Geoffrey to release the

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.660
plague.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.860
The butler hesitates, but the old man is adamant
about ending this little game.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.490
With no choice, Geoffrey opens an antique
box and takes a fancy bottle from it.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:59.279
With furrowed brows, Geoffrey sprays this
over the homo-sapiens, and one by one, the

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:02.040
people collapse as they take their final breaths.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.449
The old man simply watches this from over
his book before continuing with his reading.

00:09:06.449 --> 00:09:10.440
This story about creation depicts God as both
merciful and unforgiving.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.430
While he provides water for the thirsty beings
on his table, he also takes their lives in

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.879
a snap once he’s tired of watching them.

00:09:16.879 --> 00:09:20.839
Both Love, Death, and Robots: Ice Age and
God: Serengeti present their own versions

00:09:20.839 --> 00:09:22.459
of god-like beings.

00:09:22.459 --> 00:09:27.180
Rob and Gail watch life grow and die without
intervention but with sympathy for the civilizations

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.240
they witness.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.730
In contrast, the other presents a more involved
God who’s apathetic to the lives on his

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:44.109
table, treating them as entertainment that
he can simply turn off.
