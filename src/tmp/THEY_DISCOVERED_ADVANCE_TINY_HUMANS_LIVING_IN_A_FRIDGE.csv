"00:00:01.540"|"00:00:09.850"|"8.31"|"Today, I'm going to explain a sci-fi and fantasy show called ""Love, Death &amp; Robots: Ice Age.” Spoilers ahead!"
"00:00:11.430"|"00:00:14.140"|"2.71"|"A young couple moves into their new apartment."
"00:00:14.140"|"00:00:19.850"|"5.71"|"As Rob, the husband, brings a few boxes up into the place, his wife, Gail, tells him"
"00:00:19.850"|"00:00:23.960"|"4.11"|"about a funky old refrigerator in the corner that the landlord left behind."
"00:00:23.960"|"00:00:30.420"|"6.46"|"Rob finds it fascinating, noting how the motor is above instead of underneath like refrigerators these days."
"00:00:30.420"|"00:00:35.179"|"4.76"|"Since hot air rises, he comments that it doesn’t make sense to put the motor underneath, allowing"
"00:00:35.179"|"00:00:38.479"|"3.3"|"the hot air it produces to go up the refrigerator."
"00:00:38.479"|"00:00:43.390"|"4.91"|"However, Gail barely pays attention, and she simply agrees to the things Rob says."
"00:00:43.390"|"00:00:47.699"|"4.31"|"She then brings out a bottle of wine and asks her husband if he wants to drink."
"00:00:47.699"|"00:00:50.629"|"2.93"|"Rob gets excited and opens the old fridge to get some ice."
"00:00:50.629"|"00:00:56.309"|"5.68"|"However, the freezer is bulked up with frost, but he still manages to get a little cube of ice."
"00:00:56.309"|"00:00:59.769"|"3.46"|"The couple then makes a short toast to their new life together."
"00:00:59.769"|"00:01:03.600"|"3.83"|"Before Rob could take a sip of his drink, he notices something inside the ice."
"00:01:03.600"|"00:01:09.100"|"5.5"|"He takes it out of the glass and shows it to Gail, asking her to confirm what’s inside the ice cube."
"00:01:09.100"|"00:01:12.540"|"3.44"|"Gail looks closer and becomes just as surprised as her husband."
"00:01:12.540"|"00:01:18.369"|"5.83"|"Wanting to confirm what she saw, Gail grabs a magnifying glass to inspect the ice cube closely."
"00:01:18.369"|"00:01:22.150"|"3.78"|"Surprisingly, inside it is a miniature mammoth with spears in its body."
"00:01:22.150"|"00:01:25.670"|"3.52"|"Gail wonders if there are more of these things in the freezer, so she opens it."
"00:01:25.670"|"00:01:29.650"|"3.98"|"She quickly takes out the junk inside and gets shocked by what she sees."
"00:01:29.650"|"00:01:34.540"|"4.89"|"With this, Rob takes a peek and comments there's a lost civilization in their refrigerator."
"00:01:34.540"|"00:01:38.850"|"4.31"|"True enough, the freezer contains a miniature, working medieval city."
"00:01:38.850"|"00:01:43.090"|"4.24"|"Everything inside moves so fast, with the little people going through their day normally,"
"00:01:43.090"|"00:01:46.179"|"3.09"|"unaffected by the two giants hovering near their city."
"00:01:46.179"|"00:01:51.030"|"4.85"|"In disbelief, Gail claims that what’s happening doesn’t make sense, and Rob agrees."
"00:01:51.030"|"00:01:55.280"|"4.25"|"She then clarifies that they're seeing an early medieval city when woolly mammoths died"
"00:01:55.280"|"00:01:58.090"|"2.81"|"out sometime in the late Neolithic period."
"00:01:58.090"|"00:02:01.840"|"3.75"|"Rob shrugs it off and simply agrees with his wife to hide his ignorance."
"00:02:01.840"|"00:02:05.549"|"3.71"|"Later on, Rob buries the frozen mammoth in a pot of dirt."
"00:02:05.549"|"00:02:11.050"|"5.5"|"Rob seems sad about it, so Gail lightens up the mood and says that it'll probably make for a good fertilizer."
"00:02:11.050"|"00:02:14.540"|"3.49"|"Curiosity takes over, and the two check the freezer again."
"00:02:14.540"|"00:02:17.780"|"3.24"|"To their surprise, everything has changed drastically."
"00:02:17.780"|"00:02:22.700"|"4.92"|"What used to be a medieval city is now a modernized place during the Industrial Revolution."
"00:02:22.700"|"00:02:26.760"|"4.06"|"Factories and railroads are built, covering the freezer’s sky with smoke."
"00:02:26.760"|"00:02:30.680"|"3.92"|"The couple notes that they’ve only been gone for ten minutes, but decades have already"
"00:02:30.680"|"00:02:32.700"|"2.02"|"gone by for the miniature people."
"00:02:32.700"|"00:02:37.170"|"4.47"|"With this, Gail theorizes that time moves differently inside the freezer."
"00:02:37.170"|"00:02:42.940"|"5.77"|"As they witness the Industrial Revolution at great speed, Rob is disappointed that they missed the Renaissance period."
"00:02:42.940"|"00:02:47.150"|"4.21"|"He notices two miniature men sitting by a building under construction and wonders if"
"00:02:47.150"|"00:02:49.130"|"1.98"|"the people perceive them as gods."
"00:02:49.130"|"00:02:53.700"|"4.57"|"However, the men are actually making fun of them, seeing them as weird faces in the sky"
"00:02:53.700"|"00:02:55.340"|"1.64"|"that are staring at the city."
"00:02:55.340"|"00:02:59.580"|"4.24"|"One man even comments that he's tired of seeing the broccoli that's stuck in Gail's teeth."
"00:02:59.580"|"00:03:02.410"|"2.83"|"Seconds later, modernized buildings are erected."
"00:03:02.410"|"00:03:06.590"|"4.18"|"Rob notices things flying around, and Gail identifies them as airplanes."
"00:03:06.590"|"00:03:11.520"|"4.93"|"As more skyscrapers are built, Gail believes that the miniature people have reached the present time."
"00:03:11.520"|"00:03:17.060"|"5.54"|"Rob confirms this when he sees a Starbucks store and comments that the cafe really pops out everywhere."
"00:03:17.060"|"00:03:20.780"|"3.72"|"Just then, he notices something weird, so he takes a closer look."
"00:03:20.780"|"00:03:24.810"|"4.03"|"Suddenly, a missile falls into the middle of the city and explodes."
"00:03:24.810"|"00:03:29.520"|"4.71"|"The explosion blinds Rob, making him back away and fall onto the floor."
"00:03:29.520"|"00:03:36.250"|"6.73"|"Gail helps him up and tells him to calm down, but Rob panics, exclaiming that tactical nukes are exploding in their freezer."
"00:03:36.250"|"00:03:41.500"|"5.25"|"However, Rob's face is as red as a tomato, and Gail could barely keep a straight face."
"00:03:41.500"|"00:03:46.690"|"5.19"|"As the freezer explodes with huge nuclear bombs, Gail hands a shiny toaster to her husband,"
"00:03:46.690"|"00:03:50.840"|"4.15"|"letting him see how the heat from the explosion caused his face to glow red."
"00:03:50.840"|"00:03:55.270"|"4.43"|"Rob groans, but then he notices that the situation in the freezer just became worse."
"00:03:55.270"|"00:03:59.450"|"4.18"|"The couple stares at it as they hear screams, gunshots, and explosions."
"00:03:59.450"|"00:04:05.450"|"6.0"|"With this, Gail closes the freezer and says that the people can't possibly outgrow war in a couple of minutes."
"00:04:05.450"|"00:04:10.530"|"5.08"|"Hearing this, Rob asks what they should do, and Gail responds that they should order pizza."
"00:04:10.530"|"00:04:15.640"|"5.11"|"Later that night, the couple has pizza for dinner while they wait for the situation to die down."
"00:04:15.640"|"00:04:19.410"|"3.77"|"An hour has passed, and Rob recommends that they should check out the freezer."
"00:04:19.410"|"00:04:23.970"|"4.56"|"He hopes that the miniature people had a chance to rebuild their city, but Gail gently tells"
"00:04:23.970"|"00:04:27.360"|"3.39"|"him that they need to embrace the possibility that they didn't make it."
"00:04:27.360"|"00:04:29.910"|"2.55"|"Still, Rob goes to the freezer and opens it anyway."
"00:04:29.910"|"00:04:34.760"|"4.85"|"To their surprise, the freezer glows with luminous cities and flying cars."
"00:04:34.760"|"00:04:39.940"|"5.18"|"Gail claims that it looks like the Emerald City, but with less emerald and more futuristic devices."
"00:04:39.940"|"00:04:43.920"|"3.98"|"The sight of this makes Rob ecstatic, marveling at how beautiful everything is."
"00:04:43.920"|"00:04:49.400"|"5.48"|"Suddenly, a building emerges right in front of them, and Rob jokes that it looks like an adult toy."
"00:04:49.400"|"00:04:55.550"|"6.15"|"Just then, everything escalates, and a massive pyramid appears in the middle of the futuristic city."
"00:04:55.550"|"00:04:58.650"|"3.1"|"It glows brightly and consumes power from the bridges attached to it."
"00:04:58.650"|"00:05:02.800"|"4.15"|"Eventually, it turns into a diamond-shaped fortress and consumes the whole city until"
"00:05:02.800"|"00:05:04.750"|"1.95"|"it bursts into a ball of energy."
"00:05:04.750"|"00:05:09.280"|"4.53"|"The majestic energy explodes like a star, and streaks of light begin to zoom around"
"00:05:09.280"|"00:05:12.530"|"3.25"|"Rob and Gail's kitchen, filling their apartment with light."
"00:05:12.530"|"00:05:14.930"|"2.4"|"The wondrous light fascinates them both."
"00:05:14.930"|"00:05:20.510"|"5.58"|"During this period, it seems like the miniature people have figured out the secrets to time and space travel."
"00:05:20.510"|"00:05:26.030"|"5.52"|"After this, the streaks of light return to the freezer, gather into a sphere, and disappear."
"00:05:26.030"|"00:05:31.210"|"5.18"|"This wipes out the smiles on Rob's and Gail's faces, confused at what they just witnessed."
"00:05:31.210"|"00:05:35.770"|"4.56"|"Rob wonders if the miniature people will ever return, but Gail thinks it's unlikely."
"00:05:35.770"|"00:05:39.960"|"4.19"|"Because of this, Rob mournfully pulls the refrigerator's plug as if he’s accepting"
"00:05:39.960"|"00:05:42.270"|"2.31"|"that those tiny people will never return."
"00:05:42.270"|"00:05:46.230"|"3.96"|"Knowing that Rob has grown fond of the miniature people, Gail hugs him in comfort."
"00:05:46.230"|"00:05:49.420"|"3.19"|"She then closes the freezer, deciding to call it a day."
"00:05:49.420"|"00:05:53.370"|"3.95"|"The next day, Rob pours their cups of coffee and hands one to Gail."
"00:05:53.370"|"00:05:57.980"|"4.61"|"Without saying a word to each other, both wonder about the miniature civilization in their freezer."
"00:05:57.980"|"00:06:01.900"|"3.92"|"With the slightest bit of hope that the miniature people are still alive, they open the freezer"
"00:06:01.900"|"00:06:05.840"|"3.94"|"again to find cold mist pouring out despite it being unplugged."
"00:06:05.840"|"00:06:11.700"|"5.86"|"Inside, they witness another ice age where primitive sapiens consume the carcass of a mighty brachiosaurus."
"00:06:11.700"|"00:06:17.020"|"5.32"|"It seems like life in the freezer has restarted, and it has now returned to the age of the dinosaurs."
"00:06:17.020"|"00:06:20.930"|"3.91"|"Just then, a roar alerts the sapiens of the arriving Tyrannosaurus-Rex."
"00:06:20.930"|"00:06:24.020"|"3.09"|"The sapiens run as one is caught between the dinosaur’s teeth."
"00:06:24.020"|"00:06:28.370"|"4.35"|"The last sapiens tumbles with the T-Rex closing in, lunging for the kill."
"00:06:28.370"|"00:06:34.580"|"6.21"|"Many claims that the freezer is like a ""pocket universe"" that shows how life evolves to the point of leaving reality."
"00:06:34.580"|"00:06:38.139"|"3.56"|"Some may think that the freezer showed the end of their world, but it could also mean"
"00:06:38.139"|"00:06:41.040"|"2.9"|"that the miniature humans found a different dimension to live in."
"00:06:41.040"|"00:06:45.560"|"4.52"|"It’s uncertain how many times this process of life occurred in the old freezer or if"
"00:06:45.560"|"00:06:47.570"|"2.01"|"it always plays out the same way."
"00:06:47.570"|"00:06:51.800"|"4.23"|"The previous owners may have seen life bloom and die repeatedly, eventually getting bored"
"00:06:51.800"|"00:06:54.940"|"3.14"|"of it, thus leaving the extraordinary freezer behind."
"00:06:54.940"|"00:06:59.389"|"4.45"|"Although the show never revealed who created life inside the freezer, an episode titled"
"00:06:59.389"|"00:07:02.370"|"2.98"|"""God: Serengeti"" by Oats Studios might just suggest who did."
"00:07:02.370"|"00:07:08.710"|"6.34"|"A herd of elephants travels across a field, but their field is on a table in the middle of a mysterious man’s study."
"00:07:08.710"|"00:07:12.419"|"3.71"|"The old man doesn’t pay attention to this, as he’s busy reading a book."
"00:07:12.419"|"00:07:19.130"|"6.71"|"His butler, Geoffrey, asks how the book is, and the man comments that it’s too technical, adding that he prefers chaos."
"00:07:19.130"|"00:07:22.450"|"3.32"|"Still, he likes a recipe for a black hole from the book."
"00:07:22.450"|"00:07:26.820"|"4.37"|"He turns his attention to the little beings in his pocket world and laughs at a miniature"
"00:07:26.820"|"00:07:28.960"|"2.14"|"man who’s rubbing two sticks together."
"00:07:28.960"|"00:07:33.980"|"5.02"|"Suddenly, the Homosapien discovers how to make fire, and the old man is enraged."
"00:07:33.980"|"00:07:38.820"|"4.84"|"He complains that he didn’t say those people could do such a thing because he’s supposed to give fire."
"00:07:38.820"|"00:07:44.720"|"5.9"|"Geoffrey notes that the current time period is over 200,000 years before they’re supposed to give them fire."
"00:07:44.720"|"00:07:49.350"|"4.63"|"Because of this, the old man orders Geoffrey to put the fire out, so the butler blows onto"
"00:07:49.350"|"00:07:52.449"|"3.1"|"the table, creating the wind that snuffs out the flames."
"00:07:52.449"|"00:07:57.530"|"5.08"|"Still, the old man is pissed, so he tells Geoffrey to put them back into their caves."
"00:07:57.530"|"00:08:03.460"|"5.93"|"The butler obeys, so he triggers the elephants to stampede towards the humans, forcing them to hide."
"00:08:03.460"|"00:08:07.850"|"4.39"|"After it’s done, the old man is still annoyed at what just happened, so he plans to shrink"
"00:08:07.850"|"00:08:11.270"|"3.42"|"the brains of the tiny beings to prevent them from making their own choices."
"00:08:11.270"|"00:08:16.130"|"4.86"|"Not long after, the homo-sapiens exit the cave again to perform a rain dance."
"00:08:16.130"|"00:08:19.800"|"3.67"|"Geoffrey reminds him that they haven’t turned off the drought, so the old man orders him"
"00:08:19.800"|"00:08:22.270"|"2.47"|"to spray some water on the parched little things."
"00:08:22.270"|"00:08:27.490"|"5.22"|"Geoffrey happily obliges and sprays water over the table, causing it to rain on the field."
"00:08:27.490"|"00:08:31.030"|"3.54"|"He comments that their God is merciful as the homo-sapiens rejoice."
"00:08:31.030"|"00:08:36.740"|"5.71"|"The old man giggles at the sight of their excitement, so he orders his trusty butler to spray more water."
"00:08:36.740"|"00:08:40.529"|"3.79"|"As Geoffrey does so, new plants begin to sprout from the little field."
"00:08:40.529"|"00:08:45.660"|"5.13"|"Finally, he's had enough of this fun, and the old man tells Geoffrey to release the plague."
"00:08:45.660"|"00:08:49.860"|"4.2"|"The butler hesitates, but the old man is adamant about ending this little game."
"00:08:49.860"|"00:08:54.490"|"4.63"|"With no choice, Geoffrey opens an antique box and takes a fancy bottle from it."
"00:08:54.490"|"00:08:59.279"|"4.79"|"With furrowed brows, Geoffrey sprays this over the homo-sapiens, and one by one, the"
"00:08:59.279"|"00:09:02.040"|"2.76"|"people collapse as they take their final breaths."
"00:09:02.040"|"00:09:06.449"|"4.41"|"The old man simply watches this from over his book before continuing with his reading."
"00:09:06.449"|"00:09:10.440"|"3.99"|"This story about creation depicts God as both merciful and unforgiving."
"00:09:10.440"|"00:09:14.430"|"3.99"|"While he provides water for the thirsty beings on his table, he also takes their lives in"
"00:09:14.430"|"00:09:16.879"|"2.45"|"a snap once he’s tired of watching them."
"00:09:16.879"|"00:09:22.459"|"5.58"|"Both Love, Death, and Robots: Ice Age and God: Serengeti present their own versions of god-like beings."
"00:09:22.459"|"00:09:28.240"|"5.78"|"Rob and Gail watch life grow and die without intervention but with sympathy for the civilizations they witness."
"00:09:28.240"|"00:09:32.730"|"4.49"|"In contrast, the other presents a more involved God who’s apathetic to the lives on his"
