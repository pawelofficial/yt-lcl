"57"|"1"|"00:06:26.240"|"00:06:30.639"|"386.24"|"390.64"|"4.4"|"are more closely related to kangaroos"

"64"|"1"|"00:06:55.920"|"00:07:05.519"|"415.92"|"425.52"|"9.6"|"so only four young will survive"

"73"|"1"|"00:07:42.319"|"00:07:48.240"|"462.32"|"468.24"|"5.92"|"because tasmania was once connected to mainland australia"
