00:00:47.209 || 00:00:47.219 || the resector resource sector there I did
00:00:49.250 || 00:00:49.260 || want to ask you about what we're seeing
00:00:51.650 || 00:00:51.660 || in the silver market today the gold
00:00:53.510 || 00:00:53.520 || market the Platinum Market it seems like
00:00:57.350 || 00:00:57.360 || they're all popping amid uh fall in the
00:00:59.569 || 00:00:59.579 || US dollar we saw dramatic fall this
00:01:01.490 || 00:01:01.500 || morning so your perspective on what
00:01:03.590 || 00:01:03.600 || we're seeing in the markets today yeah
00:01:05.210 || 00:01:05.220 || it's nice to finally be talking on a day
00:01:07.490 || 00:01:07.500 || when silver is up you know and it's been
00:01:09.469 || 00:01:09.479 || up for the last few weeks here uh we're
00:01:11.330 || 00:01:11.340 || looking at our fourth consecutive green
00:01:12.770 || 00:01:12.780 || week in silver which we haven't seen in
00:01:14.990 || 00:01:15.000 || a while uh where the last year or so it
00:01:16.310 || 00:01:16.320 || seems like every time we talk we've just
00:01:17.750 || 00:01:17.760 || been getting hammered so it's kind of
00:01:20.510 || 00:01:20.520 || nice to see some green on the screen uh
00:01:22.609 || 00:01:22.619 || yeah as far as where we are now I I am
00:01:23.810 || 00:01:23.820 || confident the lows are in and silver
00:01:25.010 || 00:01:25.020 || I've said that before and I've been
00:01:27.950 || 00:01:27.960 || wrong but I do think that's the case and
00:01:29.929 || 00:01:29.939 || there's some reasoning behind that
00:01:31.429 || 00:01:31.439 || um but that doesn't mean we're not due
00:01:33.289 || 00:01:33.299 || for a short-term pullback we're getting
00:01:35.030 || 00:01:35.040 || extended here on the shorter time frames
00:01:38.350 || 00:01:38.360 || and a lot of kind of sentiment and uh
00:01:40.190 || 00:01:40.200 || you're starting to see like on Twitter
00:01:41.450 || 00:01:41.460 || for example when you start seeing the
00:01:43.069 || 00:01:43.079 || rocket ship emojis coming out again and
00:01:44.870 || 00:01:44.880 || all that that's usually kind of like a
00:01:47.390 || 00:01:47.400 || short-term caution signal but I do think
00:01:49.370 || 00:01:49.380 || I I am pretty confident here that we've
00:01:51.469 || 00:01:51.479 || kind of turned the corner in silver and
00:01:54.289 || 00:01:54.299 || platinum as well uh gold I think so too
00:01:56.569 || 00:01:56.579 || but less confident about gold you know
00:01:58.850 || 00:01:58.860 || gold is a less favorable risk reward
00:02:00.350 || 00:02:00.360 || setup in silver and platinum to me right
00:02:01.550 || 00:02:01.560 || now
00:02:04.370 || 00:02:04.380 || I I do find it interesting how you know
00:02:05.870 || 00:02:05.880 || ever since I believe it was you know
00:02:08.449 || 00:02:08.459 || last week maybe Thursday we saw that dip
00:02:10.669 || 00:02:10.679 || of silver below 19 and then it's really
00:02:13.130 || 00:02:13.140 || just been up from here
00:02:15.410 || 00:02:15.420 || um with not much pullback you say that
00:02:17.030 || 00:02:17.040 || you know the sentiment out there I mean
00:02:19.070 || 00:02:19.080 || if you're just going off you know based
00:02:21.470 || 00:02:21.480 || on what's on Twitter and everything like
00:02:24.650 || 00:02:24.660 || that uh there is maybe a bit of over
00:02:26.990 || 00:02:27.000 || excitement out there right now can you
00:02:28.729 || 00:02:28.739 || expand on that
00:02:31.910 || 00:02:31.920 || yeah um so I like um David Brady who's
00:02:33.770 || 00:02:33.780 || on our team here um he came up with this
00:02:35.570 || 00:02:35.580 || framework to analyze markets he calls it
00:02:38.390 || 00:02:38.400 || fipus f-i-p-e-s-t and that's an acronym
00:02:39.949 || 00:02:39.959 || for fundamentals in a market analysis
00:02:41.869 || 00:02:41.879 || positioning on the cot Elliott wave
00:02:44.390 || 00:02:44.400 || sentiment technicals and then slash m
00:02:46.369 || 00:02:46.379 || for manipulation and the idea is that
00:02:48.050 || 00:02:48.060 || the more of those things that kind of
00:02:50.869 || 00:02:50.879 || align for a turn in the sector the more
00:02:52.070 || 00:02:52.080 || confident you can be the attorney is
00:02:53.509 || 00:02:53.519 || happening and almost all of those things
00:02:55.309 || 00:02:55.319 || are pointing to that we've seen a turn
00:02:56.869 || 00:02:56.879 || in silver but like I said it doesn't
00:02:58.670 || 00:02:58.680 || mean we go straight up
00:03:00.770 || 00:03:00.780 || um what was support becomes resistance
00:03:03.050 || 00:03:03.060 || and in silver I mean it was major major
00:03:05.390 || 00:03:05.400 || support there right between 2150 and 22
00:03:07.790 || 00:03:07.800 || just call it 22. well here we are coming
00:03:10.790 || 00:03:10.800 || right back up to 22 area and that's
00:03:11.990 || 00:03:12.000 || going to be stiff resistance I think
00:03:13.490 || 00:03:13.500 || we're going to punch through it but
00:03:15.350 || 00:03:15.360 || often when you test a resistance level
00:03:18.410 || 00:03:18.420 || with the RSI extended above 70
00:03:20.089 || 00:03:20.099 || it's it's pretty rare that you break
00:03:21.410 || 00:03:21.420 || right through it on the first attempt so
00:03:23.509 || 00:03:23.519 || what often happens you take a stab at it
00:03:25.850 || 00:03:25.860 || 22 dollars pull back build some energy
00:03:28.009 || 00:03:28.019 || work off some of that euphoric optimism
00:03:29.690 || 00:03:29.700 || and then punch through it on the second
00:03:31.430 || 00:03:31.440 || or third time that's kind of what I'm
00:03:33.229 || 00:03:33.239 || expecting
00:03:35.149 || 00:03:35.159 || and that's for like a time frame here
00:03:36.589 || 00:03:36.599 || you're saying kind of second or third
00:03:39.050 || 00:03:39.060 || time so this could maybe play out in the
00:03:40.490 || 00:03:40.500 || next couple weeks or months or your
00:03:42.110 || 00:03:42.120 || perspective yeah yeah weeks and months
00:03:44.630 || 00:03:44.640 || not like quarters or anything like that
00:03:47.030 || 00:03:47.040 || okay yeah for and I'm talking about 22
00:03:48.289 || 00:03:48.299 || by the way
00:03:49.550 || 00:03:49.560 || um I think we'll get through twenty two
00:03:51.050 || 00:03:51.060 || dollars and you know in the coming weeks
00:03:52.509 || 00:03:52.519 || in months
00:03:55.850 || 00:03:55.860 || and we are seeing also as you know I
00:03:56.750 || 00:03:56.760 || mentioned at the beginning of this
00:03:58.490 || 00:03:58.500 || interview is the dollar Index your
00:04:00.589 || 00:04:00.599 || perspective on that because it seems
00:04:04.009 || 00:04:04.019 || like we did see quite a drawdown uh just
00:04:05.390 || 00:04:05.400 || this morning
00:04:07.070 || 00:04:07.080 || yeah and what I like about charts is
00:04:09.110 || 00:04:09.120 || they kind of they can remove your
00:04:10.850 || 00:04:10.860 || emotions their emotional bias you can
00:04:12.949 || 00:04:12.959 || just see the data and what it is and
00:04:15.410 || 00:04:15.420 || I can share my screen here but um or I
00:04:16.729 || 00:04:16.739 || can just describe it to you but yeah the
00:04:18.229 || 00:04:18.239 || dollar had gotten extremely overbought
00:04:20.870 || 00:04:20.880 || in all time frames that's no secret
00:04:22.430 || 00:04:22.440 || um everyone knows about that 120 major
00:04:24.050 || 00:04:24.060 || resistance we didn't quite get there we
00:04:27.050 || 00:04:27.060 || got up to a peak about uh 115.
00:04:29.030 || 00:04:29.040 || and we lost the 50-day moving average
00:04:31.610 || 00:04:31.620 || and you can draw an uptrend line going
00:04:34.670 || 00:04:34.680 || back to uh February of this year so it's
00:04:37.070 || 00:04:37.080 || about eight eight or nine months now
00:04:38.570 || 00:04:38.580 || perfect trend line every time we came
00:04:39.770 || 00:04:39.780 || back and back tested that boom it
00:04:42.230 || 00:04:42.240 || bounced well just um
00:04:45.050 || 00:04:45.060 || uh earlier this week we lost that
00:04:47.810 || 00:04:47.820 || support So to me that means the path of
00:04:49.730 || 00:04:49.740 || least resistance is a pullback towards
00:04:51.830 || 00:04:51.840 || the rising 200-day moving average and
00:04:53.090 || 00:04:53.100 || that's that would be a pretty
00:04:54.890 || 00:04:54.900 || significant pullback that's around 104
00:04:57.110 || 00:04:57.120 || on the dollar Index if that does
00:04:59.629 || 00:04:59.639 || materialize by the time we get there you
00:05:01.129 || 00:05:01.139 || know the dollar might be oversold and
00:05:02.870 || 00:05:02.880 || due for a bounce and
00:05:04.969 || 00:05:04.979 || you know to me when price is above a
00:05:06.409 || 00:05:06.419 || rising 200-day moving average it's still
00:05:08.930 || 00:05:08.940 || in an uptrend so to lose that uptrend
00:05:11.090 || 00:05:11.100 || status we would have to get below the
00:05:12.469 || 00:05:12.479 || 200-day moving average and then for that
00:05:14.150 || 00:05:14.160 || 200-day moving average to begin to slope
00:05:16.610 || 00:05:16.620 || lower and to the people who may think oh
00:05:18.050 || 00:05:18.060 || it's a bunch of technical analysis kind
00:05:19.610 || 00:05:19.620 || of gobbledygoot
00:05:20.290 || 00:05:20.300 || um
00:05:22.490 || 00:05:22.500 || this matters these are the things that
00:05:24.050 || 00:05:24.060 || matter to institutions the trading
00:05:25.310 || 00:05:25.320 || algorithms that really Drive these
00:05:27.290 || 00:05:27.300 || markets that's a key input into those
00:05:29.210 || 00:05:29.220 || algorithms is where is Price relative to
00:05:30.650 || 00:05:30.660 || that 200-day moving average what's the
00:05:32.210 || 00:05:32.220 || slope of the 200-day have we made higher
00:05:34.070 || 00:05:34.080 || highs and higher lows so we're starting
00:05:35.810 || 00:05:35.820 || to see the first cracks in the I'll
00:05:37.490 || 00:05:37.500 || Trend in the dollar but it's still
00:05:39.469 || 00:05:39.479 || firmly blocked in a long-term uptrend so
00:05:40.850 || 00:05:40.860 || it would be premature to say hey the
00:05:43.010 || 00:05:43.020 || uptrend is over but we're seeing some
00:05:44.450 || 00:05:44.460 || cracks in that uptrend
00:05:46.370 || 00:05:46.380 || now if we could see some of the charts
00:05:48.290 || 00:05:48.300 || maybe of the price points you're looking
00:05:50.210 || 00:05:50.220 || for on gold and silver so we can get a
00:05:52.129 || 00:05:52.139 || visual there and I know we do have some
00:05:53.570 || 00:05:53.580 || viewers in the comments asking about
00:05:55.850 || 00:05:55.860 || Platinum so we'll get to that later
00:05:57.230 || 00:05:57.240 || um but yeah definitely for all our
00:05:59.029 || 00:05:59.039 || viewers out there put in the comments
00:06:01.070 || 00:06:01.080 || section uh on the side here the live
00:06:03.110 || 00:06:03.120 || chat any questions you have for Steve
00:06:04.370 || 00:06:04.380 || and hopefully we'll be able to get them
00:06:06.050 || 00:06:06.060 || on air but yeah right now we could maybe
00:06:07.730 || 00:06:07.740 || see some of the price points on gold and
00:06:09.590 || 00:06:09.600 || silver sure and just because we're
00:06:10.790 || 00:06:10.800 || talking about it I've got the charge for
00:06:12.110 || 00:06:12.120 || the dollar up here's the uptrend line I
00:06:14.810 || 00:06:14.820 || was talking about so we we lost that
00:06:16.249 || 00:06:16.259 || um so let's pull up a chart for silver
00:06:17.990 || 00:06:18.000 || here and whenever I look at charge I
00:06:19.430 || 00:06:19.440 || like to go big to small so let's start
00:06:22.550 || 00:06:22.560 || with the kind of longer term
00:06:24.230 || 00:06:24.240 || um several year chart of silver this
00:06:27.110 || 00:06:27.120 || goes back to September of 2019. and you
00:06:28.790 || 00:06:28.800 || can see what I like I said what was
00:06:31.129 || 00:06:31.139 || support becomes resistance right here
00:06:33.290 || 00:06:33.300 || was big support going back all the way
00:06:36.770 || 00:06:36.780 || to um September of 2020 held held held
00:06:38.629 || 00:06:38.639 || once we lost that now we're coming up
00:06:40.610 || 00:06:40.620 || and testing it as resistance
00:06:41.990 || 00:06:42.000 || um on the weekly chart we're not quite
00:06:43.850 || 00:06:43.860 || overbought but when you zero in a little
00:06:45.469 || 00:06:45.479 || bit on the daily chart
00:06:47.090 || 00:06:47.100 || you can see a Confluence of resistance
00:06:48.770 || 00:06:48.780 || right here
00:06:51.170 || 00:06:51.180 || um up here on the RSI anything above
00:06:53.330 || 00:06:53.340 || that red line indicates overboughts so
00:06:54.770 || 00:06:54.780 || we're getting starting to get a little
00:06:56.570 || 00:06:56.580 || bit overbought here and we're at a
00:06:57.890 || 00:06:57.900 || Confluence of resistance you can see
00:06:59.270 || 00:06:59.280 || this downtrend line right here this red
00:07:01.370 || 00:07:01.380 || line we've tapped that several times
00:07:03.230 || 00:07:03.240 || going back to March of this year and
00:07:05.450 || 00:07:05.460 || here we are right at it now and that red
00:07:07.370 || 00:07:07.380 || line coincides with the 200-day moving
00:07:09.170 || 00:07:09.180 || average here in yellow so this is a key
00:07:11.629 || 00:07:11.639 || test right here right now in silver
00:07:13.249 || 00:07:13.259 || um what I would kind of expect is maybe
00:07:14.510 || 00:07:14.520 || a little bit of backing and filling here
00:07:15.710 || 00:07:15.720 || that seems to be the path of least
00:07:17.570 || 00:07:17.580 || resistance maybe kind of pull back
00:07:19.129 || 00:07:19.139 || you've got the 50-day moving average
00:07:21.230 || 00:07:21.240 || which is rising as support and then on
00:07:22.370 || 00:07:22.380 || the second attempt you punch through
00:07:23.629 || 00:07:23.639 || that 200 in
00:07:25.430 || 00:07:25.440 || now could we just blast right through it
00:07:27.529 || 00:07:27.539 || now yeah I mean silver is like a beach
00:07:29.390 || 00:07:29.400 || ball just held underwater or a
00:07:30.830 || 00:07:30.840 || compressed spring choose your analogy
00:07:33.170 || 00:07:33.180 || and it could just pop and keep going I
00:07:34.309 || 00:07:34.319 || don't necessarily want to see that
00:07:36.770 || 00:07:36.780 || because these vertical moves tend to you
00:07:37.510 || 00:07:37.520 || know
00:07:39.710 || 00:07:39.720 || fizzle out and they hurt the most number
00:07:41.089 || 00:07:41.099 || of retail participants so I'd rather
00:07:42.710 || 00:07:42.720 || just see a nice healthy uptrend higher
00:07:44.450 || 00:07:44.460 || highs higher lows and break through that
00:07:47.150 || 00:07:47.160 || 200-day on the second attempt
00:07:49.490 || 00:07:49.500 || you know when it comes to platinum as
00:07:51.050 || 00:07:51.060 || well if we could get your perspective on
00:07:52.249 || 00:07:52.259 || that because we're seeing you know
00:07:53.990 || 00:07:54.000 || prices we haven't seen for a while here
00:07:55.850 || 00:07:55.860 || and it seems like it is a pretty
00:07:57.830 || 00:07:57.840 || dramatic move up where we've been seeing
00:08:00.230 || 00:08:00.240 || in the last couple days yeah Platinum
00:08:02.510 || 00:08:02.520 || Platinum really has my attention here
00:08:04.249 || 00:08:04.259 || I'm going to show you the longer term
00:08:06.589 || 00:08:06.599 || chart of platinum versus gold just to
00:08:08.570 || 00:08:08.580 || highlight how undervalued this
00:08:10.129 || 00:08:10.139 || particular metal is
00:08:12.670 || 00:08:12.680 || so going back to the early 2000s
00:08:16.129 || 00:08:16.139 || Platinum traded at uh to twice the price
00:08:18.950 || 00:08:18.960 || of gold two to one ratio
00:08:21.469 || 00:08:21.479 || and historically the vast majority of
00:08:23.089 || 00:08:23.099 || the time Platinum is more expensive than
00:08:25.909 || 00:08:25.919 || gold well for several years now going
00:08:28.850 || 00:08:28.860 || back to 2008 or excuse me um
00:08:31.850 || 00:08:31.860 || uh 2015 Platinum has traded at a
00:08:33.529 || 00:08:33.539 || discount to gold which is a historic
00:08:34.969 || 00:08:34.979 || anomaly in and of itself just for
00:08:36.709 || 00:08:36.719 || platinum to be cheaper than gold well
00:08:38.690 || 00:08:38.700 || not only is it cheaper it got down to
00:08:40.310 || 00:08:40.320 || where it was like less than half the
00:08:42.589 || 00:08:42.599 || price of gold that is something that is
00:08:44.389 || 00:08:44.399 || rarely if ever seen that's like a
00:08:45.710 || 00:08:45.720 || generational opportunity from my
00:08:47.630 || 00:08:47.640 || perspective for Value contrarian
00:08:49.670 || 00:08:49.680 || investors and what we see on this ratio
00:08:51.350 || 00:08:51.360 || chart here is platinum is beginning to
00:08:52.730 || 00:08:52.740 || break out look at this resistance Line
00:08:54.650 || 00:08:54.660 || This is a long-term chart boom just
00:08:55.970 || 00:08:55.980 || broke out in these last three weeks
00:08:58.070 || 00:08:58.080 || versus gold and platinum has the
00:09:00.350 || 00:09:00.360 || potential to outperform Gold by a wide
00:09:03.590 || 00:09:03.600 || margin and I'm the biggest silver bull
00:09:05.750 || 00:09:05.760 || there is and I've got more silver than
00:09:07.430 || 00:09:07.440 || Platinum a lot more silver than Platinum
00:09:10.250 || 00:09:10.260 || however silver is the one metal that I
00:09:12.530 || 00:09:12.540 || can see potentially outperforming
00:09:14.210 || 00:09:14.220 || excuse me Platinum is the one metal I
00:09:15.710 || 00:09:15.720 || can see potentially outperforming silver
00:09:18.350 || 00:09:18.360 || in the coming years and I say potential
00:09:19.970 || 00:09:19.980 || I'm not putting a stake in the ground
00:09:22.310 || 00:09:22.320 || saying that it will but it could and you
00:09:23.930 || 00:09:23.940 || look at the ratio chart of platinum
00:09:25.790 || 00:09:25.800 || versus silver here
00:09:27.290 || 00:09:27.300 || um and you can see it's extremely
00:09:29.509 || 00:09:29.519 || undervalued Platinum just to return to
00:09:32.690 || 00:09:32.700 || where we heard were back here in uh 2008
00:09:34.490 || 00:09:34.500 || Platinum would outperform silver by a
00:09:36.170 || 00:09:36.180 || wide margin and there's a lot of
00:09:37.790 || 00:09:37.800 || potential fundamental catalysts for
00:09:39.590 || 00:09:39.600 || platinum as well so I really like the
00:09:41.509 || 00:09:41.519 || look of platinum and then one more um
00:09:43.370 || 00:09:43.380 || chart here for you of just Platinum
00:09:46.610 || 00:09:46.620 || itself before I get too long-winded
00:09:52.730 || 00:09:52.740 || and you can see we have this nice kind
00:09:55.009 || 00:09:55.019 || of like rounded bottom here this um you
00:09:56.930 || 00:09:56.940 || call it an arc pattern if you want right
00:09:59.210 || 00:09:59.220 || above this 800 support and look at just
00:10:00.769 || 00:10:00.779 || this week alone we're up almost 10
00:10:02.090 || 00:10:02.100 || percent this week
00:10:03.470 || 00:10:03.480 || um the 200-day moving average is right
00:10:05.030 || 00:10:05.040 || down here so we broke through the
00:10:06.650 || 00:10:06.660 || 200-day moving average we made a higher
00:10:08.990 || 00:10:09.000 || high above 9.75 and a higher high above
00:10:11.509 || 00:10:11.519 || 10 38. so those higher highs higher lows
00:10:13.730 || 00:10:13.740 || are what you want to see above above a
00:10:15.410 || 00:10:15.420 || rising 200-day moving average and all
00:10:17.030 || 00:10:17.040 || the pieces are in place right now for
00:10:20.449 || 00:10:20.459 || you know uh a sustained move higher in
00:10:21.889 || 00:10:21.899 || Platinum I'm not saying if I go to the
00:10:23.690 || 00:10:23.700 || moon tomorrow or anything but I think
00:10:24.889 || 00:10:24.899 || we're probably going to resume the
00:10:26.269 || 00:10:26.279 || uptrend here
00:10:27.650 || 00:10:27.660 || um getting technically stretched on the
00:10:29.690 || 00:10:29.700 || daily chart here's the 200 day so we
00:10:31.610 || 00:10:31.620 || could pull back down to towards this 950
00:10:33.350 || 00:10:33.360 || area and to me that would be a good
00:10:35.050 || 00:10:35.060 || entry point
00:10:37.670 || 00:10:37.680 || no we do have a viewer here asking about
00:10:39.230 || 00:10:39.240 || platinum and I know there are a lot of
00:10:40.610 || 00:10:40.620 || different ways uh you can purchase
00:10:43.550 || 00:10:43.560 || Platinum I know even Sprott has like a
00:10:45.949 || 00:10:45.959 || platinum and Palladium ETF you can own
00:10:47.990 || 00:10:48.000 || the physical metal and there are for
00:10:49.970 || 00:10:49.980 || platinum it's interesting there are 10th
00:10:51.590 || 00:10:51.600 || ounce Platinum coins that some people
00:10:53.750 || 00:10:53.760 || like for you know extreme divisibility
00:10:56.090 || 00:10:56.100 || what is your favorite way to take
00:10:58.430 || 00:10:58.440 || advantage of this possible up upward
00:11:00.410 || 00:11:00.420 || move in Platinum yeah I love that
00:11:01.850 || 00:11:01.860 || question because it's actionable
00:11:04.490 || 00:11:04.500 || information what can I do with this well
00:11:06.590 || 00:11:06.600 || if you most people want to
00:11:08.030 || 00:11:08.040 || first question they asked me what's
00:11:09.769 || 00:11:09.779 || what's your favorite Mining stock well
00:11:11.449 || 00:11:11.459 || it's really hard to find a pure play
00:11:13.670 || 00:11:13.680 || Platinum Mining stock
00:11:16.069 || 00:11:16.079 || most platinum deposits are poly metallic
00:11:17.750 || 00:11:17.760 || so you've got nickel and Cobalt and
00:11:18.829 || 00:11:18.839 || copper and all these other things in
00:11:20.030 || 00:11:20.040 || there which are fine I'm bullish on
00:11:21.110 || 00:11:21.120 || those but it's hard to find pure play
00:11:22.850 || 00:11:22.860 || exposure to platinum so I personally
00:11:26.150 || 00:11:26.160 || prefer just the physical Mill myself and
00:11:28.670 || 00:11:28.680 || then my plan if I can is to swap that
00:11:30.710 || 00:11:30.720 || Platinum for gold down the road as that
00:11:32.509 || 00:11:32.519 || ratio normalizes you know hopefully I
00:11:35.030 || 00:11:35.040 || get a lot more gold by by buying
00:11:36.290 || 00:11:36.300 || Platinum now and swapping it for gold
00:11:39.650 || 00:11:39.660 || later you mentioned those uh ETFs the
00:11:41.690 || 00:11:41.700 || Sprout one I like that but you know I'm
00:11:43.310 || 00:11:43.320 || less bullish on Palladium than platinum
00:11:45.590 || 00:11:45.600 || and they lump the two together so by
00:11:47.210 || 00:11:47.220 || buying that ETF you get five and then
00:11:48.490 || 00:11:48.500 || Palladium well I just want Platinum
00:11:52.910 || 00:11:52.920 || there's pplt that's a platinum ETF what
00:11:55.490 || 00:11:55.500 || I don't like about that is it's I think
00:11:57.170 || 00:11:57.180 || it's the Aberdeen Platinum trust or
00:12:00.290 || 00:12:00.300 || platinum ETF JP Morgan's the custodian
00:12:02.449 || 00:12:02.459 || so it's kind of like buying SLV it just
00:12:04.490 || 00:12:04.500 || you know it just doesn't sit right with
00:12:06.170 || 00:12:06.180 || me personally um but if you want Pure
00:12:08.389 || 00:12:08.399 || Play exposure to just the price pplt is
00:12:11.329 || 00:12:11.339 || an ETF but I rather just on the physical
00:12:13.009 || 00:12:13.019 || definitely and when it comes to the
00:12:13.970 || 00:12:13.980 || physical
00:12:16.490 || 00:12:16.500 || um I know I mean with respect to buying
00:12:18.230 || 00:12:18.240 || like physical gold and silver some of
00:12:20.210 || 00:12:20.220 || the times people like to buy like the
00:12:22.490 || 00:12:22.500 || American products and easy divisibility
00:12:24.470 || 00:12:24.480 || if there was to be a currency crisis you
00:12:25.790 || 00:12:25.800 || know that you could barter with but with
00:12:27.650 || 00:12:27.660 || Platinum it doesn't seem like there's
00:12:29.750 || 00:12:29.760 || necessarily that need to buy like the
00:12:32.090 || 00:12:32.100 || coins it seems like bars are just as
00:12:34.430 || 00:12:34.440 || good your perspective on that
00:12:36.710 || 00:12:36.720 || yeah I I don't think it really matters
00:12:38.690 || 00:12:38.700 || too much um I just buy one ounce bars
00:12:42.110 || 00:12:42.120 || generic bars myself uh here here would
00:12:44.389 || 00:12:44.399 || be my answer I guess wherever I get the
00:12:45.889 || 00:12:45.899 || lowest premium
00:12:48.230 || 00:12:48.240 || I think that's a very good point there
00:12:50.329 || 00:12:50.339 || now when it comes to
00:12:52.850 || 00:12:52.860 || I guess what we're looking forward here
00:12:54.650 || 00:12:54.660 || in the precious metals if you could
00:12:56.930 || 00:12:56.940 || reiterate for our viewers kind of
00:12:58.910 || 00:12:58.920 || um for those viewers just joining right
00:12:59.870 || 00:12:59.880 || now
00:13:02.449 || 00:13:02.459 || um what needs to happen for precious
00:13:04.430 || 00:13:04.440 || metals to continue this rally and what
00:13:06.530 || 00:13:06.540 || would be the best outcome moving forward
00:13:08.990 || 00:13:09.000 || after you know this week or two that
00:13:10.730 || 00:13:10.740 || we've just seen pretty much a vertical
00:13:13.190 || 00:13:13.200 || move up in Precious Metals okay so I'll
00:13:14.930 || 00:13:14.940 || go in reverse order there uh best
00:13:18.170 || 00:13:18.180 || outcome to me would be a pullback but a
00:13:20.030 || 00:13:20.040 || gentle one low volume if you look at
00:13:22.490 || 00:13:22.500 || charts you want to see high volume price
00:13:24.170 || 00:13:24.180 || Rises and low volume pullbacks to
00:13:27.230 || 00:13:27.240 || support so um you know I'd like to see
00:13:29.329 || 00:13:29.339 || pullbacks towards the 200-day moving
00:13:30.050 || 00:13:30.060 || average
00:13:32.210 || 00:13:32.220 || specifically in Platinum and then for
00:13:33.889 || 00:13:33.899 || support to hold a little bit of sideways
00:13:35.389 || 00:13:35.399 || consolidation and then move up and take
00:13:37.190 || 00:13:37.200 || out resistance after you know a few
00:13:38.870 || 00:13:38.880 || weeks of consolidation you know a week
00:13:40.910 || 00:13:40.920 || or two uh that I think that will be the
00:13:42.949 || 00:13:42.959 || best scenario for everyone
00:13:43.790 || 00:13:43.800 || um
00:13:45.829 || 00:13:45.839 || and going back to the the other oh you
00:13:47.389 || 00:13:47.399 || said what needs to happen
00:13:49.550 || 00:13:49.560 || um well I think all the pieces are in
00:13:51.170 || 00:13:51.180 || place and I hate to to beat this horse
00:13:52.310 || 00:13:52.320 || to death because everyone's talking
00:13:54.710 || 00:13:54.720 || about the FED but that's the reality is
00:13:56.750 || 00:13:56.760 || that's the the near-term drivers fed
00:13:58.970 || 00:13:58.980 || policy and you know I've said on your
00:14:00.290 || 00:14:00.300 || show many times you know I think that
00:14:02.810 || 00:14:02.820 || the path is going to be they'll slow the
00:14:04.430 || 00:14:04.440 || rate of interest rates then kind of
00:14:06.829 || 00:14:06.839 || pause and then they'll do a 180 at some
00:14:08.569 || 00:14:08.579 || point I don't think I don't think we
00:14:10.730 || 00:14:10.740 || have to wait for that 180 to see the big
00:14:12.949 || 00:14:12.959 || Catalyst I think the when they just slow
00:14:15.110 || 00:14:15.120 || and there I think their language at the
00:14:16.610 || 00:14:16.620 || last meeting kind of indicated
00:14:18.110 || 00:14:18.120 || hey we're going to start slowing the
00:14:19.430 || 00:14:19.440 || rate here because the markets are
00:14:22.069 || 00:14:22.079 || forward-looking I think ever where it
00:14:23.509 || 00:14:23.519 || might seem like a lot of analysts
00:14:26.030 || 00:14:26.040 || disagree I think all of us kind of see
00:14:28.550 || 00:14:28.560 || that slow pause 180 trajectory it's just
00:14:29.930 || 00:14:29.940 || we're mixing you know different words
00:14:30.949 || 00:14:30.959 || mean different things to different
00:14:33.170 || 00:14:33.180 || people it's like to me a pivot
00:14:36.470 || 00:14:36.480 || means a pivot is like this you know a
00:14:37.850 || 00:14:37.860 || slight change in Direction but you're
00:14:39.590 || 00:14:39.600 || going to continue changing that way to
00:14:41.030 || 00:14:41.040 || some people I think the pivot means like
00:14:43.189 || 00:14:43.199 || just full-on QE debt monetization just
00:14:45.110 || 00:14:45.120 || like no I don't think anyone expects
00:14:46.910 || 00:14:46.920 || them to just go full you know from what
00:14:48.710 || 00:14:48.720 || they're doing right now hey you know
00:14:50.150 || 00:14:50.160 || what we're going to start pumping QE and
00:14:52.189 || 00:14:52.199 || uh debt monetization send me checks out
00:14:54.110 || 00:14:54.120 || like it's a process and once that
00:14:56.269 || 00:14:56.279 || process begins that's the pivot and the
00:14:57.769 || 00:14:57.779 || medals will anticipate that and I think
00:15:00.530 || 00:15:00.540 || that's worth starting to see right now
00:15:02.030 || 00:15:02.040 || you're saying that the medals are
00:15:03.590 || 00:15:03.600 || anticipating that but like the latest
00:15:06.590 || 00:15:06.600 || fed meeting seemed to not hinted that at
00:15:08.389 || 00:15:08.399 || all because it seemed like Powell was
00:15:11.090 || 00:15:11.100 || very double or very hawkish and saying
00:15:12.530 || 00:15:12.540 || that we need to get inflation under
00:15:16.009 || 00:15:16.019 || control so what is giving you the
00:15:18.410 || 00:15:18.420 || um incline or giving you the idea that
00:15:20.449 || 00:15:20.459 || the FED is looking to Pivot sometime in
00:15:23.150 || 00:15:23.160 || the near future yeah so wait at the uh
00:15:24.829 || 00:15:24.839 || at the press release
00:15:27.650 || 00:15:27.660 || um it indicated the pivot and then uh in
00:15:29.750 || 00:15:29.760 || the comments after the interviews where
00:15:32.090 || 00:15:32.100 || he kind of went back to that hawkish uh
00:15:33.710 || 00:15:33.720 || comments but we're seeing things from
00:15:36.769 || 00:15:36.779 || like the World Bank and afterwards was
00:15:39.769 || 00:15:39.779 || it cash carry or uh like TF Metals uh
00:15:42.050 || 00:15:42.060 || Craig MKE calls him dead goons I I
00:15:43.370 || 00:15:43.380 || forget their names but one of the FED
00:15:46.730 || 00:15:46.740 || ruins came out and they kind of like
00:15:48.769 || 00:15:48.779 || polish they come out and make follow-on
00:15:52.069 || 00:15:52.079 || remarks um indicating you know we're
00:15:53.269 || 00:15:53.279 || starting to see them float trial
00:15:54.949 || 00:15:54.959 || balloons kind of preparing the market
00:15:58.430 || 00:15:58.440 || for slowing the rate of increase you
00:16:01.310 || 00:16:01.320 || know um so there have been elements and
00:16:03.590 || 00:16:03.600 || it was mixed messaging in that last J
00:16:06.350 || 00:16:06.360 || Powell uh you know the fomc meeting
00:16:08.150 || 00:16:08.160 || because the markets rallied at first
00:16:10.550 || 00:16:10.560 || because he did indicate a slight pivot
00:16:12.290 || 00:16:12.300 || but then in the remarks afterwards is
00:16:15.350 || 00:16:15.360 || when he kind of backpedaled on that
00:16:17.150 || 00:16:17.160 || now it seems like the end game of all
00:16:19.250 || 00:16:19.260 || this is If the Fed does pivot then we're
00:16:21.650 || 00:16:21.660 || gonna see it increase to devaluation of
00:16:24.470 || 00:16:24.480 || the currency and we're seeing around the
00:16:26.810 || 00:16:26.820 || world countries moving towards gold
00:16:28.730 || 00:16:28.740 || investors around the world taking
00:16:31.790 || 00:16:31.800 || delivery of metals off the comex uh both
00:16:33.530 || 00:16:33.540 || gold and silver
00:16:35.210 || 00:16:35.220 || um your perspective on this and we also
00:16:37.249 || 00:16:37.259 || do have a viewer's uh comment here about
00:16:39.889 || 00:16:39.899 || how they believe that you know money has
00:16:42.230 || 00:16:42.240 || flowed into cryptocurrencies it's kind
00:16:43.730 || 00:16:43.740 || of a safe haven an alternative currency
00:16:46.850 || 00:16:46.860 || but that money will flow eventually into
00:16:49.790 || 00:16:49.800 || precious metals your perspective on that
00:16:51.889 || 00:16:51.899 || yeah 100 and just one quick follow-up
00:16:53.930 || 00:16:53.940 || thought on the FED pivot
00:16:56.269 || 00:16:56.279 || um Jay Pals also said we're going to get
00:16:58.069 || 00:16:58.079 || positive real interest rates and again
00:16:59.210 || 00:16:59.220 || that can mean a lot of different things
00:17:00.650 || 00:17:00.660 || to a lot of different people
00:17:01.970 || 00:17:01.980 || um what do you compare it to most of us
00:17:03.590 || 00:17:03.600 || I think would be inclined to look at the
00:17:06.289 || 00:17:06.299 || CPI which is you know somewhere around
00:17:08.210 || 00:17:08.220 || um it just came out uh seven point
00:17:10.429 || 00:17:10.439 || something percent annualized so you'd
00:17:11.390 || 00:17:11.400 || say oh well they got to raise interest
00:17:13.370 || 00:17:13.380 || rates above that that's not what the FED
00:17:16.189 || 00:17:16.199 || looks at they look at pce core and that
00:17:19.069 || 00:17:19.079 || pce core is around 5.2 it's five point
00:17:21.770 || 00:17:21.780 || something I want to say 5.2
00:17:24.650 || 00:17:24.660 || um so to them by their definition if
00:17:27.470 || 00:17:27.480 || they can get the uh pce code or excuse
00:17:29.870 || 00:17:29.880 || me interest rates up to or above that
00:17:32.150 || 00:17:32.160 || pce core so around five percent which is
00:17:33.470 || 00:17:33.480 || what they're targeting right now so if
00:17:34.730 || 00:17:34.740 || inflation comes down just a little bit
00:17:36.830 || 00:17:36.840 || down into the force by that pce core
00:17:38.870 || 00:17:38.880 || metric and they get interest rates to
00:17:40.490 || 00:17:40.500 || five that they're going to say hey
00:17:42.289 || 00:17:42.299 || victory positive real interest rates and
00:17:43.490 || 00:17:43.500 || I think that can happen by January
00:17:44.630 || 00:17:44.640 || February and the markets are looking
00:17:46.970 || 00:17:46.980 || beyond that that's where the pause comes
00:17:47.630 || 00:17:47.640 || um
00:17:49.970 || 00:17:49.980 || to your follow-on question
00:17:52.130 || 00:17:52.140 || um yeah money coming from crypto yeah
00:17:54.950 || 00:17:54.960 || last time I know the crypto market cap
00:17:57.350 || 00:17:57.360 || total market cap you know exceeded a
00:17:59.510 || 00:17:59.520 || trillion dollars there so if say half of
00:18:00.950 || 00:18:00.960 || that comes out or a percentage of that
00:18:02.930 || 00:18:02.940 || yeah that's enough to and it goes into
00:18:05.510 || 00:18:05.520 || silver and gold yeah it's enough to have
00:18:07.250 || 00:18:07.260 || an impact I don't think it's enough to
00:18:08.330 || 00:18:08.340 || like send it
00:18:10.430 || 00:18:10.440 || to the moon or through you know these
00:18:12.529 || 00:18:12.539 || big resistance levels but it will be a
00:18:14.150 || 00:18:14.160 || positive impact and I think that that
00:18:15.230 || 00:18:15.240 || will happen you know money will
00:18:17.210 || 00:18:17.220 || gradually come out of crypto I'm not
00:18:18.529 || 00:18:18.539 || saying crypto is going away or anything
00:18:20.390 || 00:18:20.400 || like that but I think some will come out
00:18:22.010 || 00:18:22.020 || of it and into the medals and it'll be a
00:18:23.630 || 00:18:23.640 || tail end just another Talent as we move
00:18:24.590 || 00:18:24.600 || forward
00:18:26.510 || 00:18:26.520 || there's a difference in history there
00:18:28.669 || 00:18:28.679 || right behind those two assets where the
00:18:30.350 || 00:18:30.360 || cryptocurrencies have been around for 10
00:18:32.810 || 00:18:32.820 || maybe a little over 10 years but
00:18:34.490 || 00:18:34.500 || precious metals gold and silver have
00:18:37.250 || 00:18:37.260 || been around for 6 000 years so it seems
00:18:39.049 || 00:18:39.059 || like in this kind of environment where
00:18:41.990 || 00:18:42.000 || we may see a move out of uh paper
00:18:44.029 || 00:18:44.039 || currencies it seems like the first thing
00:18:46.070 || 00:18:46.080 || to look at should be precious metals if
00:18:48.289 || 00:18:48.299 || we're going on a historical uh if we're
00:18:50.870 || 00:18:50.880 || going by history yeah six thousand years
00:18:54.230 || 00:18:54.240 || of History are history is replete with
00:18:58.070 || 00:18:58.080 || hundreds of examples of some other
00:19:00.470 || 00:19:00.480 || form of money trying to replace gold and
00:19:01.970 || 00:19:01.980 || silver as the primary source of money
00:19:03.650 || 00:19:03.660 || and it's never worked gold and silver
00:19:06.770 || 00:19:06.780 || have been money for 6 000 years and you
00:19:09.890 || 00:19:09.900 || know unless this time is different
00:19:12.350 || 00:19:12.360 || um it's going to be again or it still is
00:19:14.390 || 00:19:14.400 || and it but what I meant to say there is
00:19:16.370 || 00:19:16.380 || for six thousand years gold always does
00:19:17.810 || 00:19:17.820 || a full accounting for the expansion of
00:19:20.510 || 00:19:20.520 || debt-based currency it always 100 of the
00:19:22.610 || 00:19:22.620 || time has done that and this time will be
00:19:24.650 || 00:19:24.660 || no different
00:19:26.450 || 00:19:26.460 || all right well Steve Penny we really

00:19:52.850 || 00:19:52.860 || no um it's been a rough you know a
00:19:54.169 || 00:19:54.179 || couple years here really I was going to
00:19:55.310 || 00:19:55.320 || say a few months but really a couple
00:19:58.490 || 00:19:58.500 || years since that August 2020 high and
00:20:00.650 || 00:20:00.660 || it's hard I mean it's it's not easy for
00:20:01.970 || 00:20:01.980 || me either but
00:20:04.850 || 00:20:04.860 || you know I I I believe with 100

00:20:08.810 || 00:20:08.820 || sectors that this time is not different
00:20:11.690 || 00:20:11.700 || the gold and silver will do uh will
00:20:14.390 || 00:20:14.400 || perform as they have in the past and you
00:20:16.549 || 00:20:16.559 || know volatility is rough but don't
00:20:19.370 || 00:20:19.380 || conflate volatility for risk
00:20:20.750 || 00:20:20.760 || um you know I can't think of a lower
00:20:23.630 || 00:20:23.640 || risk sector to be in as far as risk
00:20:24.890 || 00:20:24.900 || rewards set up over the next few years
00:20:26.570 || 00:20:26.580 || then the precious metals market so thank
00:20:28.490 || 00:20:28.500 || you for inviting me Elijah of course
