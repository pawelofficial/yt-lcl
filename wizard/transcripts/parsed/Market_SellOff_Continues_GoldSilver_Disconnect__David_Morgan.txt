00:00:02.270 || 00:00:02.280 || hey everyone this is Elijah K Johnson
00:00:04.730 || 00:00:04.740 || and back with us today is our good
00:00:06.769 || 00:00:06.779 || friend David Morgan the founder of the
00:00:09.169 || 00:00:09.179 || Morgan report and one of the top silver
00:00:11.030 || 00:00:11.040 || experts David thank you so much for
00:00:13.129 || 00:00:13.139 || joining us today well Elijah look
00:00:14.509 || 00:00:14.519 || forward to it thank you
00:00:16.310 || 00:00:16.320 || well it's great to have you on today I
00:00:17.570 || 00:00:17.580 || wanted to have you on and turn this
00:00:19.130 || 00:00:19.140 || actually into a live stream we weren't
00:00:20.810 || 00:00:20.820 || planning on this so I just kind of made
00:00:23.510 || 00:00:23.520 || this decision 30 minutes ago because
00:00:25.250 || 00:00:25.260 || um you know we see a lot of movements in
00:00:26.870 || 00:00:26.880 || the markets today following the FED
00:00:28.790 || 00:00:28.800 || meetings uh the FED meeting this week
00:00:30.710 || 00:00:30.720 || and the FED decision to raise rates
00:00:32.870 || 00:00:32.880 || again three quarters of a point
00:00:35.750 || 00:00:35.760 || um the Dow is now down to new lows we're
00:00:37.610 || 00:00:37.620 || seeing gold and silver at least the
00:00:41.270 || 00:00:41.280 || paper prices uh Fall Again gold around
00:00:44.810 || 00:00:44.820 || 1650 silver you know dipping below the
00:00:47.330 || 00:00:47.340 || 19 level again your take on what is
00:00:49.790 || 00:00:49.800 || happening in the markets right now
00:00:53.209 || 00:00:53.219 || well it's uh knee-jerk or typical
00:00:55.250 || 00:00:55.260 || reaction to an increase in interest
00:00:58.130 || 00:00:58.140 || rates increasing rates are very negative
00:00:59.750 || 00:00:59.760 || for the stock market
00:01:01.130 || 00:01:01.140 || and
00:01:04.250 || 00:01:04.260 || it's implied and heavily touted that
00:01:05.870 || 00:01:05.880 || increased interest rates are very
00:01:07.550 || 00:01:07.560 || detrimental to gold
00:01:10.250 || 00:01:10.260 || and you know based on today you'd say
00:01:11.990 || 00:01:12.000 || well that's an absolute or it's true
00:01:14.390 || 00:01:14.400 || it's true in the short term really as
00:01:16.609 || 00:01:16.619 || I've said many times and there's others
00:01:19.370 || 00:01:19.380 || out there in the blogosphere that agree
00:01:22.670 || 00:01:22.680 || that for gold to really be hurt by
00:01:24.830 || 00:01:24.840 || increasing interest rates it has to be
00:01:27.410 || 00:01:27.420 || an interest rate to measure it with the
00:01:29.929 || 00:01:29.939 || inflation rate meaning it's got to be
00:01:31.789 || 00:01:31.799 || above the inflation rate to have any
00:01:34.370 || 00:01:34.380 || real rate of return otherwise you're
00:01:36.830 || 00:01:36.840 || better off in the precious metal so one
00:01:38.810 || 00:01:38.820 || day doesn't make a market I'm a little
00:01:41.170 || 00:01:41.180 || surprised I'm glad I kept my mouse shut
00:01:45.550 || 00:01:45.560 || because we had um
00:01:49.069 || 00:01:49.079 || sorry about that we had uh actually
00:01:52.429 || 00:01:52.439 || after the 75 basis points we actually
00:01:53.929 || 00:01:53.939 || saw gold and silver up yesterday
00:01:56.810 || 00:01:56.820 || slightly and I thought they're shrugging
00:01:59.030 || 00:01:59.040 || it off and it was kind of smiling about
00:02:01.569 || 00:02:01.579 || it but again kept my mouth shut so today
00:02:04.969 || 00:02:04.979 || everything's selling off people know but
00:02:06.889 || 00:02:06.899 || needs to be
00:02:09.529 || 00:02:09.539 || is that many times
00:02:13.430 || 00:02:13.440 || the money powers that work within the
00:02:16.309 || 00:02:16.319 || system do have exposure to gold
00:02:19.190 || 00:02:19.200 || but it's in the paper markets and they
00:02:21.710 || 00:02:21.720 || need to sell whatever they can sell
00:02:24.890 || 00:02:24.900 || and so gold is easy to hit with a mouse
00:02:28.430 || 00:02:28.440 || if you're in an ETF like the GLD or the
00:02:30.830 || 00:02:30.840 || SLB or something like that so it's
00:02:33.050 || 00:02:33.060 || typical that all these markets
00:02:36.470 || 00:02:36.480 || sympathize together at a sell-off but
00:02:37.670 || 00:02:37.680 || once that's
00:02:40.369 || 00:02:40.379 || taken care of in a matter of days
00:02:44.509 || 00:02:44.519 || usually you usually see gold rebound
00:02:46.670 || 00:02:46.680 || so you are looking for a gold rebound
00:02:48.470 || 00:02:48.480 || here and it is interesting what we have
00:02:50.030 || 00:02:50.040 || been seeing in Precious Metals lately
00:02:52.250 || 00:02:52.260 || it's been a big disconnect between gold
00:02:54.290 || 00:02:54.300 || and silver the gold silver ratio has
00:02:57.410 || 00:02:57.420 || fallen significantly so gold is you know
00:02:59.509 || 00:02:59.519 || the price where it hasn't been for a
00:03:01.970 || 00:03:01.980 || while but silver is actually above uh
00:03:04.369 || 00:03:04.379 || its recent lows so your perspective on
00:03:08.030 || 00:03:08.040 || why we're seeing this Divergence uh of
00:03:09.710 || 00:03:09.720 || the gold and silver prices
00:03:11.750 || 00:03:11.760 || yeah it's very interesting question I
00:03:14.030 || 00:03:14.040 || did an interview with uh he's not a
00:03:16.850 || 00:03:16.860 || Floor Trader but he's a an avid Trader
00:03:18.589 || 00:03:18.599 || and I've only interviewed with him two
00:03:19.670 || 00:03:19.680 || or three times but he's very
00:03:21.110 || 00:03:21.120 || knowledgeable especially on technical
00:03:22.910 || 00:03:22.920 || analysis so we got into the discussion
00:03:26.869 || 00:03:26.879 || about that topic and I said look when I
00:03:28.910 || 00:03:28.920 || started trading seriously I was taught
00:03:31.790 || 00:03:31.800 || that whites leave the yellow at Platinum
00:03:34.190 || 00:03:34.200 || Palladium and silver actually lead gold
00:03:37.430 || 00:03:37.440 || after 40 years of experience I'm saying
00:03:40.970 || 00:03:40.980 || that's not necessarily true uh gold can
00:03:42.410 || 00:03:42.420 || lead I mean you look at the bull market
00:03:44.390 || 00:03:44.400 || and gold gold started up in the year
00:03:46.850 || 00:03:46.860 || 2000 Silver didn't really start up until
00:03:50.210 || 00:03:50.220 || September 2003 and I called that
00:03:51.350 || 00:03:51.360 || Breakout
00:03:54.530 || 00:03:54.540 || so gold LED on the way up then you look
00:03:56.750 || 00:03:56.760 || at the top silver lead because silver
00:03:59.170 || 00:03:59.180 || peaked the last day of April early May
00:04:02.089 || 00:04:02.099 || 2011 it wasn't until September the Gold
00:04:05.149 || 00:04:05.159 || Peak it's my point Elijah is this
00:04:08.149 || 00:04:08.159 || silver had already bottomed and the gold
00:04:10.009 || 00:04:10.019 || silver ratio would verify the fact
00:04:12.289 || 00:04:12.299 || everyone's streaming that gold had
00:04:14.750 || 00:04:14.760 || broken uh technical support level which
00:04:17.870 || 00:04:17.880 || it had but I my contention was that
00:04:20.030 || 00:04:20.040 || silver was leading this time and it does
00:04:22.550 || 00:04:22.560 || lead on many of the bigger turning
00:04:25.010 || 00:04:25.020 || points and you would see the gold silver
00:04:27.170 || 00:04:27.180 || ratio verify what it's saying so far so
00:04:28.670 || 00:04:28.680 || good even though Silver's off like
00:04:30.890 || 00:04:30.900 || almost four percent it goes off one and
00:04:31.909 || 00:04:31.919 || a half percent if we're doing the
00:04:34.129 || 00:04:34.139 || interview uh again one day it doesn't
00:04:36.770 || 00:04:36.780 || make a market I think so far I'm right I
00:04:39.890 || 00:04:39.900 || think I will be proven right that
00:04:43.010 || 00:04:43.020 || um the worst is over for silver and
00:04:45.290 || 00:04:45.300 || maybe not for gold but longer term I'm
00:04:48.350 || 00:04:48.360 || still looking uh during these depressing
00:04:50.450 || 00:04:50.460 || times for Metals investors
00:04:53.030 || 00:04:53.040 || for a better year-end in other words I
00:04:54.409 || 00:04:54.419 || think you're going to see
00:04:56.749 || 00:04:56.759 || you know better prices by year end of
00:04:59.629 || 00:04:59.639 || this year for both the metals
00:05:01.490 || 00:05:01.500 || and when it comes to where they are
00:05:02.810 || 00:05:02.820 || right now and where they're heading I
00:05:04.969 || 00:05:04.979 || know that you've said that uh this well
00:05:06.950 || 00:05:06.960 || the action we're seeing right now this
00:05:09.230 || 00:05:09.240 || Divergence May signal actually a bottom
00:05:12.170 || 00:05:12.180 || for uh both gold and silver however they
00:05:14.090 || 00:05:14.100 || could fall lower but what what it's
00:05:15.650 || 00:05:15.660 || signaling is the bottom can you expand
00:05:17.390 || 00:05:17.400 || on that
00:05:20.870 || 00:05:20.880 || yeah well I you know I just gave you one
00:05:22.430 || 00:05:22.440 || of my key points and that's a gold
00:05:23.930 || 00:05:23.940 || silver ratio and that's gone from like
00:05:26.210 || 00:05:26.220 || 95 down to 86 it's a pretty big
00:05:28.029 || 00:05:28.039 || percentage turned from the end of August
00:05:31.850 || 00:05:31.860 || so uh there's that as a fact and the
00:05:33.529 || 00:05:33.539 || other thing is sentiment and the other
00:05:35.990 || 00:05:36.000 || thing is uh what's going on with the
00:05:37.249 || 00:05:37.259 || fundamentals I mean you've got
00:05:38.930 || 00:05:38.940 || backwardation and silver you've got
00:05:40.430 || 00:05:40.440 || increasing leasing rates in silver
00:05:42.950 || 00:05:42.960 || you've got a great amount of silver
00:05:45.290 || 00:05:45.300 || that's come off of the market in
00:05:48.170 || 00:05:48.180 || physical form even lady leaving the
00:05:50.330 || 00:05:50.340 || London bullion Association
00:05:52.790 || 00:05:52.800 || so the fundamentals are there and
00:05:54.710 || 00:05:54.720 || sediment just sucks I mean everyone
00:05:56.810 || 00:05:56.820 || thinks that you know why did it ever get
00:05:58.129 || 00:05:58.139 || into precious metals are supposed to be
00:06:00.350 || 00:06:00.360 || helping me during inflation you know we
00:06:03.230 || 00:06:03.240 || the Dow's down but you know so
00:06:06.170 || 00:06:06.180 || so those several indicators usually
00:06:09.170 || 00:06:09.180 || bottoms are full of pessimism and
00:06:11.930 || 00:06:11.940 || believe me from where I said there's a
00:06:13.969 || 00:06:13.979 || lot of pessimists out there and of
00:06:16.189 || 00:06:16.199 || course the stalwarts will always be
00:06:18.529 || 00:06:18.539 || holding and these are people that uh I
00:06:21.290 || 00:06:21.300 || know and care about but some of them and
00:06:23.870 || 00:06:23.880 || I say some not all probably will never
00:06:26.629 || 00:06:26.639 || part with them this position or part of
00:06:28.309 || 00:06:28.319 || it and I of course Advocate that there
00:06:30.050 || 00:06:30.060 || will come a time where we'll want to
00:06:32.870 || 00:06:32.880 || cash out not necessarily for Fiat or for
00:06:35.570 || 00:06:35.580 || another asset class land the raw land
00:06:39.050 || 00:06:39.060 || real estate business payoff debt start a
00:06:41.809 || 00:06:41.819 || foundation I don't know but something
00:06:43.430 || 00:06:43.440 || and for those just joining right now
00:06:44.990 || 00:06:45.000 || we're with David Morgan of their Morgan
00:06:46.790 || 00:06:46.800 || report in the live chat if you'd like
00:06:48.770 || 00:06:48.780 || your questions answered today just type
00:06:50.090 || 00:06:50.100 || your questions and hopefully they'll be
00:06:52.909 || 00:06:52.919 || able to answer them on air here one
00:06:54.890 || 00:06:54.900 || question I did have for you David was
00:06:57.529 || 00:06:57.539 || how does this compare to what we saw in
00:06:59.870 || 00:06:59.880 || the 80s because we're seeing a lot of uh
00:07:02.990 || 00:07:03.000 || comparison of the inflation today as we
00:07:06.770 || 00:07:06.780 || did see in the 17 1970s and 80s but the
00:07:08.270 || 00:07:08.280 || one thing that isn't a comparison right
00:07:10.010 || 00:07:10.020 || now it seems like is the precious metals
00:07:11.870 || 00:07:11.880 || because we're not seeing them you know
00:07:15.469 || 00:07:15.479 || go uh parabolic as we did back in 1980.
00:07:17.270 || 00:07:17.280 || I know that you know you were an
00:07:18.890 || 00:07:18.900 || investor back then and experienced that
00:07:20.809 || 00:07:20.819 || so your perspective on the parallels
00:07:22.850 || 00:07:22.860 || that we're seeing and could we be moving
00:07:25.969 || 00:07:25.979 || into that maybe a few years down the
00:07:28.010 || 00:07:28.020 || road that parabolic top that we saw in
00:07:28.969 || 00:07:28.979 || the 80s
00:07:31.370 || 00:07:31.380 || I do think we will see it again Elijah
00:07:32.809 || 00:07:32.819 || and I do think it's probably going to
00:07:37.070 || 00:07:37.080 || take place through 2023 and into 2024.
00:07:39.290 || 00:07:39.300 || you know my best guess and I'll say it's
00:07:42.290 || 00:07:42.300 || a guess would be by let's say third
00:07:44.749 || 00:07:44.759 || quarter 2024 which is basically two
00:07:47.450 || 00:07:47.460 || years from right now you'll probably see
00:07:50.210 || 00:07:50.220 || a huge acceleration in the crisis not
00:07:52.189 || 00:07:52.199 || ultimate good question you know it's
00:07:55.129 || 00:07:55.139 || reminiscent of me knowing about going
00:07:57.350 || 00:07:57.360 || off you know renting Woods The Gold
00:08:00.170 || 00:08:00.180 || Standard August 15 1971 and all this
00:08:02.990 || 00:08:03.000 || Metals had hard money Advocates honest
00:08:05.390 || 00:08:05.400 || money and all that knew what was going
00:08:07.070 || 00:08:07.080 || to happen in the future we used to know
00:08:08.870 || 00:08:08.880 || how much time it would take and exactly
00:08:11.390 || 00:08:11.400 || what the market would do but we saw that
00:08:13.850 || 00:08:13.860 || gold reacted very positively from the
00:08:16.909 || 00:08:16.919 || fixed price of 422 most people say 35
00:08:18.469 || 00:08:18.479 || doesn't matter it can take whatever
00:08:19.790 || 00:08:19.800 || number you want
00:08:22.490 || 00:08:22.500 || yeah I'll just talk about the 42-20 for
00:08:24.890 || 00:08:24.900 || a minute did you asked
00:08:27.589 || 00:08:27.599 || actually devalued the dollar and said
00:08:29.390 || 00:08:29.400 || gold was worth more of these in you know
00:08:31.909 || 00:08:31.919 || in dollar terms and they did it once and
00:08:33.350 || 00:08:33.360 || they never did it again because they
00:08:34.909 || 00:08:34.919 || they thought it through and they go we
00:08:36.589 || 00:08:36.599 || can't do that because we do that we're
00:08:38.209 || 00:08:38.219 || telling people the dollar is losing
00:08:42.110 || 00:08:42.120 || value so anyway from the 35 an ounce
00:08:44.870 || 00:08:44.880 || it went up to about 200. and we were all
00:08:46.490 || 00:08:46.500 || kind of patting ourselves on the back
00:08:48.530 || 00:08:48.540 || and saying you know Gold's doing its job
00:08:50.570 || 00:08:50.580 || and you know it wasn't much resistance
00:08:52.190 || 00:08:52.200 || on the way up well then it got cut
00:08:55.130 || 00:08:55.140 || almost in half and it dropped down to
00:08:57.470 || 00:08:57.480 || like one mere 100
00:08:59.870 || 00:08:59.880 || and we were you know down in the mouth
00:09:02.090 || 00:09:02.100 || Guam and why is gold doing this we have
00:09:03.949 || 00:09:03.959 || more inflation and the economy is not
00:09:05.329 || 00:09:05.339 || getting better and gold should be doing
00:09:07.690 || 00:09:07.700 || better than it is and you know
00:09:10.190 || 00:09:10.200 || and then it went from that bottom 100
00:09:12.889 || 00:09:12.899 || all the way up to 850. but it took some
00:09:15.590 || 00:09:15.600 || time to do that so I think a similar
00:09:19.130 || 00:09:19.140 || markets repeat but not exactly so we had
00:09:22.370 || 00:09:22.380 || a run of 11 years from you know 252
00:09:24.530 || 00:09:24.540 || dollar gold in U.S terms all the way up
00:09:28.250 || 00:09:28.260 || to like 1900 ish an 11 year time frame
00:09:30.949 || 00:09:30.959 || and then we went kind of a full circle
00:09:33.290 || 00:09:33.300 || from 1900 down to I forget the bottom
00:09:35.930 || 00:09:35.940 || 1100 or so and all the way back up to
00:09:37.910 || 00:09:37.920 || about 1900 now we're kind of going
00:09:41.090 || 00:09:41.100 || sideways we're 1647 today as we're
00:09:42.410 || 00:09:42.420 || talking
00:09:45.170 || 00:09:45.180 || so it's kind of a slow motion of what
00:09:47.690 || 00:09:47.700 || happened in the 70s it's like that 200
00:09:51.290 || 00:09:51.300 || cut in half and then it took off so you
00:09:53.389 || 00:09:53.399 || know we went from 1900 to I'm going to
00:09:55.370 || 00:09:55.380 || say 1100 I think it's 10.50 I have to
00:09:58.490 || 00:09:58.500 || look but roughly cut in half similar but
00:10:01.370 || 00:10:01.380 || it's going slower uh meaning
00:10:04.130 || 00:10:04.140 || you know more time but I think once we
00:10:05.870 || 00:10:05.880 || get through this
00:10:08.690 || 00:10:08.700 || process of sell-offs and what's going on
00:10:10.550 || 00:10:10.560 || the paper markets and the financial
00:10:11.930 || 00:10:11.940 || markets in general
00:10:14.810 || 00:10:14.820 || that you will see gold you know get bit
00:10:18.170 || 00:10:18.180 || above the 1950 or 1960 whatever the top
00:10:22.730 || 00:10:22.740 || is silver will it may lead I mean it's
00:10:24.949 || 00:10:24.959 || already broken out in my view
00:10:27.590 || 00:10:27.600 || whether it will lead on the way up
00:10:30.710 || 00:10:30.720 || I don't know it could uh that's a tough
00:10:32.630 || 00:10:32.640 || tough call Silver even for a silver
00:10:34.850 || 00:10:34.860 || analysts it's a tough Market
00:10:37.130 || 00:10:37.140 || but what we do know is they both will
00:10:38.990 || 00:10:39.000 || accelerate and once things really get
00:10:40.670 || 00:10:40.680 || going I'm very convinced the Civil
00:10:43.250 || 00:10:43.260 || outperforms but I'm not going to stick
00:10:44.810 || 00:10:44.820 || my neck out any further than I already
00:10:48.050 || 00:10:48.060 || have that it's going to
00:10:49.790 || 00:10:49.800 || I'll pay school right from the start
00:10:51.170 || 00:10:51.180 || here
00:10:53.990 || 00:10:54.000 || no we're hearing a lot about new markets
00:10:55.970 || 00:10:55.980 || opening up around the world a viewer
00:10:58.610 || 00:10:58.620 || here at Thomas is wanting to know do you
00:11:00.590 || 00:11:00.600 || think the Russian and Chinese precious
00:11:02.569 || 00:11:02.579 || metal markets will affect the U.S
00:11:04.630 || 00:11:04.640 || precious Mueller prices
00:11:07.970 || 00:11:07.980 || tough one I'm a deep thinker I don't you
00:11:09.530 || 00:11:09.540 || know I'll answer off the cuff I'm not
00:11:12.110 || 00:11:12.120 || sure yet I want to see how much volume
00:11:14.870 || 00:11:14.880 || they have I mean this idea of what's
00:11:16.550 || 00:11:16.560 || going on with sanctions and everyone's
00:11:18.230 || 00:11:18.240 || allowed to form their own opinion but
00:11:21.110 || 00:11:21.120 || why would you cut off gold from the lbma
00:11:22.910 || 00:11:22.920 || if it's made you know if it's produced
00:11:25.730 || 00:11:25.740 || in Russia I mean gold is gold it's
00:11:27.949 || 00:11:27.959 || fungible it's the same element but they
00:11:32.210 || 00:11:32.220 || did so now that space has taken on the
00:11:34.009 || 00:11:34.019 || idea that they'll do their own
00:11:37.850 || 00:11:37.860 || will it affect it to be determined off
00:11:40.190 || 00:11:40.200 || the cuff I don't think it'll have a huge
00:11:42.829 || 00:11:42.839 || impact but it's hard to say especially
00:11:45.170 || 00:11:45.180 || if there is some type of default or
00:11:46.250 || 00:11:46.260 || let's say
00:11:47.990 || 00:11:48.000 || something comes into the international
00:11:51.230 || 00:11:51.240 || news which I'm anticipating by the way
00:11:54.290 || 00:11:54.300 || that uh is detrimental to Precious
00:11:56.990 || 00:11:57.000 || Metals holders in the physical side if
00:11:59.690 || 00:11:59.700 || something like that were to occur then
00:12:03.170 || 00:12:03.180 || you might see a big rush into not only
00:12:06.790 || 00:12:06.800 || the metals that exist but verification
00:12:10.550 || 00:12:10.560 || of what's already held by
00:12:13.069 || 00:12:13.079 || funds family offices individual
00:12:15.350 || 00:12:15.360 || investors money managers and that type
00:12:17.150 || 00:12:17.160 || of thing
00:12:20.389 || 00:12:20.399 || now I think the the main I guess the
00:12:22.130 || 00:12:22.140 || thing behind the question may be the
00:12:23.389 || 00:12:23.399 || manipulation of the precious metal
00:12:25.370 || 00:12:25.380 || markets some people do believe that
00:12:26.990 || 00:12:27.000 || precious metal markets are manipulated
00:12:29.810 || 00:12:29.820 || and opening more exchanges would make it
00:12:32.389 || 00:12:32.399 || more uh freely traded what's your
00:12:34.310 || 00:12:34.320 || perspective on that
00:12:37.130 || 00:12:37.140 || I mean basically we've had you know with
00:12:39.410 || 00:12:39.420 || Shanghai exchange and we've had all
00:12:41.630 || 00:12:41.640 || these exchanges yet they all basically
00:12:45.769 || 00:12:45.779 || Center off the lbma or the comex
00:12:47.569 || 00:12:47.579 || um I mean I did a study that's in the
00:12:50.269 || 00:12:50.279 || silver Manifesto that talks about the
00:12:52.190 || 00:12:52.200 || differential between the price of the
00:12:54.650 || 00:12:54.660 || lbma and on the comex and it's not Iran
00:12:57.470 || 00:12:57.480 || walk it proves it's manipulated and just
00:12:59.030 || 00:12:59.040 || for the record because I just finished
00:13:01.190 || 00:13:01.200 || with the silver Symposium I got on stage
00:13:03.290 || 00:13:03.300 || and you know I'm almost tired of hearing
00:13:06.110 || 00:13:06.120 || ordered manipulation I don't deny it but
00:13:07.910 || 00:13:07.920 || I mean by long-term statement very clear
00:13:09.650 || 00:13:09.660 || I've said this in the past and I'll say
00:13:10.550 || 00:13:10.560 || it here
00:13:14.569 || 00:13:14.579 || my take it's mine is that the long-term
00:13:17.569 || 00:13:17.579 || Trend cannot be manipulated
00:13:19.790 || 00:13:19.800 || but within that Trend it can be
00:13:21.769 || 00:13:21.779 || manipulated like crazy
00:13:24.470 || 00:13:24.480 || and that's what I think is still a valid
00:13:26.629 || 00:13:26.639 || statement I mean again we saw school go
00:13:30.230 || 00:13:30.240 || up 11 years in a row from 2000 and 2011.
00:13:33.110 || 00:13:33.120 || and uh silver did actually outperformed
00:13:35.030 || 00:13:35.040 || me on a few of those years but it's been
00:13:37.250 || 00:13:37.260 || a really rough 10 years for Metals
00:13:39.110 || 00:13:39.120 || investors as we all know
00:13:42.290 || 00:13:42.300 || it could it depends on volume if the
00:13:44.329 || 00:13:44.339 || volume that takes place on the Shanghai
00:13:46.850 || 00:13:46.860 || or this Russian exchange is you know
00:13:49.370 || 00:13:49.380 || three times what takes place at the lbma
00:13:51.769 || 00:13:51.779 || you better to have an effect
00:13:54.110 || 00:13:54.120 || but right now the volumes are not
00:13:56.389 || 00:13:56.399 || significant enough to have any effect or
00:14:02.810 || 00:14:02.820 || now we have a question here um also from
00:14:04.850 || 00:14:04.860 || a viewer they want to know when the
00:14:06.470 || 00:14:06.480 || relative strength of the dollar comes
00:14:09.410 || 00:14:09.420 || down won't gold and silver take off so
00:14:12.530 || 00:14:12.540 || kind of your perspective on the impact
00:14:15.710 || 00:14:15.720 || of inflation on precious metals and also
00:14:16.490 || 00:14:16.500 || um
00:14:18.530 || 00:14:18.540 || isn't that the main reason that the
00:14:20.750 || 00:14:20.760 || price of gold and silver are down so it
00:14:22.850 || 00:14:22.860 || seems ironic right now
00:14:24.290 || 00:14:24.300 || um that we're seeing inflation but
00:14:26.210 || 00:14:26.220 || precious metals are
00:14:28.490 || 00:14:28.500 || um down so it's very it's very
00:14:30.230 || 00:14:30.240 || counterintuitive not exactly what you'd
00:14:31.790 || 00:14:31.800 || expect right now
00:14:34.970 || 00:14:34.980 || and yes it is sort of what I expect and
00:14:37.129 || 00:14:37.139 || I've talked about this over and over
00:14:38.389 || 00:14:38.399 || again
00:14:41.810 || 00:14:41.820 || and it is in times of distress in times
00:14:43.970 || 00:14:43.980 || of what we call liquidity crisis where
00:14:46.850 || 00:14:46.860 || you want to have your money as safe as
00:14:49.189 || 00:14:49.199 || possible if you look at you can look it
00:14:51.710 || 00:14:51.720 || up on the internet folks this is new to
00:14:53.090 || 00:14:53.100 || you or you want to review it and heard
00:14:56.090 || 00:14:56.100 || it before is the extra pyramid exter
00:14:58.250 || 00:14:58.260 || pyramid it's an upside down pyramid it's
00:15:01.069 || 00:15:01.079 || a very very good
00:15:04.250 || 00:15:04.260 || um pictorial of the financial system and
00:15:08.750 || 00:15:08.760 || what it shows is the as confidence is
00:15:10.670 || 00:15:10.680 || less and less in other words people have
00:15:12.590 || 00:15:12.600 || less and less faith in the system less
00:15:14.329 || 00:15:14.339 || and less faith in the stock market less
00:15:16.730 || 00:15:16.740 || than the state and the leaders in the
00:15:18.829 || 00:15:18.839 || banks and everything they go to what
00:15:20.449 || 00:15:20.459 || they trust the most
00:15:22.610 || 00:15:22.620 || so the most trusted thing on the planet
00:15:24.590 || 00:15:24.600 || as far as quote unquote money is
00:15:26.449 || 00:15:26.459 || concerned it's really currency is the US
00:15:27.290 || 00:15:27.300 || dollar
00:15:30.530 || 00:15:30.540 || I mean when Zimbabwe failed what was
00:15:32.990 || 00:15:33.000 || being used precious metals but primarily
00:15:35.629 || 00:15:35.639 || greenbacks U.S dollar bills we're in
00:15:37.670 || 00:15:37.680 || Zimbabwe and that's true many nation
00:15:40.430 || 00:15:40.440 || states so it's not unusual to see as
00:15:42.650 || 00:15:42.660 || this fear becomes more pervasive
00:15:44.870 || 00:15:44.880 || throughout the entire world's Financial
00:15:47.629 || 00:15:47.639 || system the go-to thing is the dollar and
00:15:48.949 || 00:15:48.959 || the dollar is going up against
00:15:50.389 || 00:15:50.399 || everything
00:15:53.150 || 00:15:53.160 || until it doesn't and what does that mean
00:15:56.210 || 00:15:56.220 || David it means that people say well wait
00:15:57.829 || 00:15:57.839 || a minute I've got these dollars and I
00:16:00.230 || 00:16:00.240 || feel safe but I'm losing about eight and
00:16:01.850 || 00:16:01.860 || a half percent every year and that's the
00:16:05.389 || 00:16:05.399 || official number it's more like 12 or 15.
00:16:07.550 || 00:16:07.560 || in my experience when I buy groceries
00:16:10.069 || 00:16:10.079 || and I buy gas when I pay my rent when I
00:16:11.750 || 00:16:11.760 || pay my utilities
00:16:14.090 || 00:16:14.100 || now what do I do these dollars aren't
00:16:15.949 || 00:16:15.959 || working either even though they're
00:16:17.569 || 00:16:17.579 || working better than the stock market
00:16:19.610 || 00:16:19.620 || better than the bond market better than
00:16:22.189 || 00:16:22.199 || my real estate Investments that's when
00:16:25.189 || 00:16:25.199 || the shift goes to gold and that's what
00:16:28.490 || 00:16:28.500 || this extra pyramid says or shows and I
00:16:29.750 || 00:16:29.760 || believe that's the case so I actually
00:16:33.889 || 00:16:33.899 || expect gold to go up at the same time as
00:16:35.689 || 00:16:35.699 || the dollar for a while
00:16:37.490 || 00:16:37.500 || and then there'll be a shift probably
00:16:39.769 || 00:16:39.779 || out of dollars in Precious Metals but
00:16:41.629 || 00:16:41.639 || you know this is
00:16:43.790 || 00:16:43.800 || it's theory in a way I mean it's been
00:16:45.889 || 00:16:45.899 || proven in the past but doesn't
00:16:47.269 || 00:16:47.279 || necessarily mean it's going to happen
00:16:49.730 || 00:16:49.740 || the future so it's not unusual for my
00:16:51.470 || 00:16:51.480 || thinking that we see a running dollar
00:16:53.650 || 00:16:53.660 || first and once it runs at a dollar
00:16:57.590 || 00:16:57.600 || exhaust because wait a minute you know
00:16:59.329 || 00:16:59.339 || I've got a thousand dollars but by the
00:17:01.490 || 00:17:01.500 || end of the year it's only worth 500
00:17:04.549 || 00:17:04.559 || that's an extreme example I better do
00:17:06.949 || 00:17:06.959 || something else I need something else
00:17:08.569 || 00:17:08.579 || that's held through all of history so
00:17:09.289 || 00:17:09.299 || far
00:17:11.750 || 00:17:11.760 || has been the precious bonus
00:17:13.669 || 00:17:13.679 || yeah it definitely does seem uh kind of
00:17:15.289 || 00:17:15.299 || looking at the viewers questions again a
00:17:17.390 || 00:17:17.400 || question question again here I think I
00:17:19.010 || 00:17:19.020 || understand it a bit more of yeah they're
00:17:20.449 || 00:17:20.459 || talking about relative strength of the
00:17:22.250 || 00:17:22.260 || of the dollar which we're seeing the
00:17:23.809 || 00:17:23.819 || dollar quite strong right now even
00:17:25.250 || 00:17:25.260 || though we're seeing inflation against
00:17:27.230 || 00:17:27.240 || other currencies it's quite strong so we
00:17:28.490 || 00:17:28.500 || are seeing pressure on the metals there
00:17:30.409 || 00:17:30.419 || I mean I think as you mentioned yet I
00:17:32.690 || 00:17:32.700 || mean sometimes they can rise together
00:17:35.150 || 00:17:35.160 || but eventually people at home will
00:17:37.549 || 00:17:37.559 || realize prices are going up and you just
00:17:39.470 || 00:17:39.480 || can't buy as much with the dollar as you
00:17:41.029 || 00:17:41.039 || used to is that kind of what you're
00:17:42.289 || 00:17:42.299 || getting at and that's when the Run
00:17:45.289 || 00:17:45.299 || activities yeah goes down the pyramid I
00:17:47.330 || 00:17:47.340 || mean the pyramid clearly shows that the
00:17:50.270 || 00:17:50.280 || the next best thing to gold is is the
00:17:51.289 || 00:17:51.299 || dollar
00:17:53.990 || 00:17:54.000 || and it is I mean we're proving it in the
00:17:55.370 || 00:17:55.380 || markets right now I mean there's little
00:17:58.750 || 00:17:58.760 || debates of fact but then again
00:18:01.250 || 00:18:01.260 || then when you lose faith in the dollar
00:18:03.409 || 00:18:03.419 || the game's over I mean it's not like I'm
00:18:04.850 || 00:18:04.860 || cheering for gold to go to the
00:18:06.710 || 00:18:06.720 || stratosphere and it won't it'll maintain
00:18:09.169 || 00:18:09.179 || its value or exceed it probably this
00:18:10.789 || 00:18:10.799 || time
00:18:12.950 || 00:18:12.960 || no one wants to demise in the financial
00:18:14.330 || 00:18:14.340 || system
00:18:17.150 || 00:18:17.160 || but it's structured to fail I mean from
00:18:19.370 || 00:18:19.380 || the get-go you cannot compound interest
00:18:22.190 || 00:18:22.200 || indefinitely it's impossible and that's
00:18:23.510 || 00:18:23.520 || kind of where we're at now that's why
00:18:25.430 || 00:18:25.440 || the bond market is finally after 40
00:18:28.549 || 00:18:28.559 || years starting to fail
00:18:31.610 || 00:18:31.620 || and once uh there's going to be tough
00:18:33.650 || 00:18:33.660 || times ahead I mean the main information
00:18:35.450 || 00:18:35.460 || I can give to
00:18:37.909 || 00:18:37.919 || our audience is live within your means
00:18:39.830 || 00:18:39.840 || you know get used to having a lower
00:18:42.289 || 00:18:42.299 || lifestyle and embrace it if you can but
00:18:44.570 || 00:18:44.580 || I said I mean no one wants to you know
00:18:47.870 || 00:18:47.880 || give up some of their you know movie
00:18:50.330 || 00:18:50.340 || going or whatever but the point is that
00:18:52.310 || 00:18:52.320 || hard times are coming
00:18:54.230 || 00:18:54.240 || and um
00:18:57.409 || 00:18:57.419 || money is going to be less valuable and I
00:19:00.169 || 00:19:00.179 || think the very few places to go will be
00:19:02.330 || 00:19:02.340 || probably the precious metals but even
00:19:05.090 || 00:19:05.100 || that you know I'm not I'm open-minded
00:19:08.270 || 00:19:08.280 || enough to say well if the reset occurs
00:19:10.789 || 00:19:10.799 || before precious metals have had the run
00:19:14.930 || 00:19:14.940 || which I doubt but could then uh you know
00:19:16.610 || 00:19:16.620 || what do I have to do make an apology to
00:19:19.310 || 00:19:19.320 || everybody I mean I've tried my best to
00:19:22.549 || 00:19:22.559 || be a valued of service to others and you
00:19:25.310 || 00:19:25.320 || know Silver's still today's price is
00:19:27.830 || 00:19:27.840 || what 19 bucks that's more than you know
00:19:32.150 || 00:19:32.160 || the 450 we started at and gold at 1647
00:19:35.570 || 00:19:35.580 || as I just said and we started in 252.
00:19:37.490 || 00:19:37.500 || but uh it's not over till it's over
00:19:39.409 || 00:19:39.419 || either so that's my explanation I hope
00:19:40.970 || 00:19:40.980 || it didn't make sense to you Elijah
00:19:42.590 || 00:19:42.600 || because this doesn't this does fit
00:19:43.630 || 00:19:43.640 || within
00:19:46.789 || 00:19:46.799 || my thinking that yeah running a dollar
00:19:49.669 || 00:19:49.679 || has to take place prior to the run from
00:19:51.470 || 00:19:51.480 || dollars into gold
00:19:53.330 || 00:19:53.340 || I think that definitely does make sense
00:19:55.370 || 00:19:55.380 || to me and and one of the things that
00:19:57.110 || 00:19:57.120 || we're getting in the comments here and I
00:19:59.210 || 00:19:59.220 || get this question often you mentioned
00:20:01.130 || 00:20:01.140 || how you know what if the reset happens
00:20:03.350 || 00:20:03.360 || first or something like that and there
00:20:05.029 || 00:20:05.039 || are a lot of future scenarios that
00:20:07.370 || 00:20:07.380 || people kind of think are going to happen
00:20:09.110 || 00:20:09.120 || in the future but at the end of the day
00:20:11.690 || 00:20:11.700 || we really don't know some people ask in
00:20:13.990 || 00:20:14.000 || the comments about confiscation or
00:20:16.490 || 00:20:16.500 || nationalization of Minds your
00:20:19.130 || 00:20:19.140 || perspective on kind of how do we best
00:20:22.070 || 00:20:22.080 || prepare for the future not really
00:20:23.630 || 00:20:23.640 || knowing what it might be what government
00:20:25.490 || 00:20:25.500 || regulations might be if there's
00:20:27.650 || 00:20:27.660 || confiscation in the future or whatever
00:20:29.750 || 00:20:29.760 || but your perspective on that just to
00:20:31.430 || 00:20:31.440 || kind of reduce risk overall how do
00:20:34.850 || 00:20:34.860 || people do that yeah my take and I am
00:20:37.070 || 00:20:37.080 || somewhat biased very studied in these
00:20:38.690 || 00:20:38.700 || markets as far as the medals are
00:20:40.490 || 00:20:40.500 || concerned I really doubt there'll be
00:20:43.190 || 00:20:43.200 || confiscation I really doubt it a
00:20:45.470 || 00:20:45.480 || nationalization I doubt that will take
00:20:46.549 || 00:20:46.559 || place either
00:20:50.090 || 00:20:50.100 || uh but we could get in a situation where
00:20:52.490 || 00:20:52.500 || the oil situation or the energy problems
00:20:55.909 || 00:20:55.919 || are so vast that you know if you're uh
00:20:58.610 || 00:20:58.620 || leader of the pack certain polite terms
00:21:00.590 || 00:21:00.600 || you might make a determination that
00:21:02.090 || 00:21:02.100 || you're going to mine silver but not gold
00:21:05.330 || 00:21:05.340 || why because the energy crunch is so bad
00:21:07.190 || 00:21:07.200 || that you have X amount of energy to
00:21:08.990 || 00:21:09.000 || devote to Mining and silver is very
00:21:11.150 || 00:21:11.160 || useful and thousands of applications
00:21:13.310 || 00:21:13.320 || gold is useless except for two things
00:21:15.470 || 00:21:15.480 || jewelry and money it's very good at
00:21:18.110 || 00:21:18.120 || those things but uh if you had to keep
00:21:20.690 || 00:21:20.700 || your Society going and had to choose one
00:21:22.430 || 00:21:22.440 || medal you would choose silver over gold
00:21:24.590 || 00:21:24.600 || there's no doubt about it so I just made
00:21:26.870 || 00:21:26.880 || that point kind of off the cuff to make
00:21:28.850 || 00:21:28.860 || sure that people understand
00:21:32.930 || 00:21:32.940 || that nationalization for silver it's
00:21:35.450 || 00:21:35.460 || impossible I mean if you take silver as
00:21:38.270 || 00:21:38.280 || a monetary asset where would the price
00:21:40.430 || 00:21:40.440 || have to be in paper terms to have any
00:21:43.250 || 00:21:43.260 || meaningful amount I mean you have to be
00:21:45.289 || 00:21:45.299 || in you know thousand you'd have to be
00:21:47.510 || 00:21:47.520 || equal to Gold basically you'd have to
00:21:51.049 || 00:21:51.059 || have a one-to-one uh you know ratio gold
00:21:53.990 || 00:21:54.000 || silver Ratio or Gold's at 1657 and
00:21:56.090 || 00:21:56.100 || Silver's at 16.57
00:21:59.270 || 00:21:59.280 || has a roughly the same amount of gold
00:22:01.730 || 00:22:01.740 || and silver above ground in investment
00:22:04.010 || 00:22:04.020 || form actually silver is lower than gold
00:22:06.370 || 00:22:06.380 || so I don't think silver ever be
00:22:09.649 || 00:22:09.659 || re-monetized by governments but it will
00:22:12.409 || 00:22:12.419 || be re-monetized by We the People there's
00:22:14.450 || 00:22:14.460 || no doubt that uh like the load project
00:22:17.210 || 00:22:17.220 || that I'm associated with and others that
00:22:19.070 || 00:22:19.080 || are out there where you can trade
00:22:22.370 || 00:22:22.380 || cryptos that are asset backed and put
00:22:25.490 || 00:22:25.500 || silver and gold back into transactions
00:22:28.789 || 00:22:28.799 || and this is taking place as we speak so
00:22:30.049 || 00:22:30.059 || um there is
00:22:32.450 || 00:22:32.460 || a bright future in my view for for the
00:22:36.289 || 00:22:36.299 || metals but it will not be in my view
00:22:39.590 || 00:22:39.600 || through the system as it exists now it
00:22:41.990 || 00:22:42.000 || will be an alternative system which the
00:22:44.330 || 00:22:44.340 || blockchain is really all about
00:22:47.270 || 00:22:47.280 || now if we could uh go back and circle
00:22:48.830 || 00:22:48.840 || back to where we started this interview
00:22:50.450 || 00:22:50.460 || of what we're seeing in the markets
00:22:52.250 || 00:22:52.260 || today we're seeing you know the stock
00:22:54.649 || 00:22:54.659 || market fall down to new lows that we
00:22:57.289 || 00:22:57.299 || haven't seen this whole year so now it
00:22:59.690 || 00:22:59.700 || is back to around 20 down if we look at
00:23:02.270 || 00:23:02.280 || the Dow the Dow under 30 000.
00:23:04.130 || 00:23:04.140 || um can you share again with our viewers
00:23:06.169 || 00:23:06.179 || your perspective on this and do we have
00:23:08.510 || 00:23:08.520 || further to fall is this just the
00:23:10.970 || 00:23:10.980 || beginning of a further crash it's the
00:23:12.409 || 00:23:12.419 || beginning of the further crash that
00:23:13.669 || 00:23:13.679 || doesn't mean it's going to go down the
00:23:14.810 || 00:23:14.820 || rest of the week the rest of the month
00:23:17.930 || 00:23:17.940 || but it is the stock market has really
00:23:20.630 || 00:23:20.640 || disconnected from the economy but
00:23:22.130 || 00:23:22.140 || eventually it will catch up and it'll
00:23:23.930 || 00:23:23.940 || have to face reality which means far
00:23:27.110 || 00:23:27.120 || lower stock prices why stocks are based
00:23:29.990 || 00:23:30.000 || on one thing in reality not it can lose
00:23:32.570 || 00:23:32.580 || its mind for a while it's based on
00:23:33.770 || 00:23:33.780 || earnings
00:23:36.409 || 00:23:36.419 || the reason you buy a company I like to
00:23:37.730 || 00:23:37.740 || think of buying a company and you buy
00:23:41.090 || 00:23:41.100 || XYZ is because it produces
00:23:44.810 || 00:23:44.820 || uh garments that everybody wants and
00:23:46.669 || 00:23:46.679 || they're very valuable and everybody and
00:23:48.470 || 00:23:48.480 || so you're sharing the profits the stock
00:23:51.350 || 00:23:51.360 || market is based on a business that
00:23:53.750 || 00:23:53.760 || produces a profit and the shareholders
00:23:56.570 || 00:23:56.580 || that own the business profit by getting
00:23:58.850 || 00:23:58.860 || dividends in the company
00:24:02.090 || 00:24:02.100 || but if you are an entity that's on the
00:24:03.710 || 00:24:03.720 || stock exchange you don't have any
00:24:05.630 || 00:24:05.640 || profits whatsoever and you haven't had
00:24:08.210 || 00:24:08.220 || any for 10 years then why are you even
00:24:09.529 || 00:24:09.539 || in that company
00:24:11.930 || 00:24:11.940 || and this reality will come to the forest
00:24:13.490 || 00:24:13.500 || Things become Tighter and Tighter and
00:24:16.730 || 00:24:16.740 || Tighter meaning that money
00:24:19.909 || 00:24:19.919 || um starts to revalue against other goods
00:24:21.950 || 00:24:21.960 || and services or things you need keep you
00:24:24.049 || 00:24:24.059 || increasing in price and have it in
00:24:26.230 || 00:24:26.240 || another do dad whatever
00:24:28.690 || 00:24:28.700 || electronic goodie
00:24:30.710 || 00:24:30.720 || decreases in price because you've
00:24:32.570 || 00:24:32.580 || already got one that works
00:24:34.250 || 00:24:34.260 || so everything you need is going to cost
00:24:35.570 || 00:24:35.580 || more and everything that's pretty much
00:24:38.270 || 00:24:38.280 || on Leverage which means real estate auto
00:24:40.970 || 00:24:40.980 || loans student loans you know signature
00:24:42.590 || 00:24:42.600 || loans those type of things are probably
00:24:45.529 || 00:24:45.539 || in most cases devalue so they'll be
00:24:46.909 || 00:24:46.919 || worth less so you're going to have this
00:24:49.010 || 00:24:49.020 || bifurcation of stuff you need costs more
00:24:51.289 || 00:24:51.299 || and stuff you don't need costs less and
00:24:53.149 || 00:24:53.159 || then you're going to have a lot of
00:24:55.130 || 00:24:55.140 || people waking up to the idea we talked
00:24:57.350 || 00:24:57.360 || about if there's repeating now wait a
00:24:58.970 || 00:24:58.980 || minute I've got all these dollars and I
00:25:01.310 || 00:25:01.320 || feel safe stock markets go down real
00:25:03.110 || 00:25:03.120 || estate isn't doing well dollars are
00:25:05.029 || 00:25:05.039 || great wait a minute they're not that
00:25:07.669 || 00:25:07.679 || great they're losing value too so I'm
00:25:09.230 || 00:25:09.240 || still of the thesis
00:25:12.590 || 00:25:12.600 || after years in this business that there
00:25:14.510 || 00:25:14.520 || is a place for medals and I've never
00:25:16.610 || 00:25:16.620 || said everything goes into Metals I'm
00:25:19.549 || 00:25:19.559 || overweighted but it's what I do but for
00:25:23.810 || 00:25:23.820 || most people just a five or ten percent
00:25:25.850 || 00:25:25.860 || um amount in the medals could be
00:25:28.850 || 00:25:28.860 || significant enough to take care of
00:25:31.190 || 00:25:31.200 || business if everything falls apart and
00:25:33.710 || 00:25:33.720 || it won't the world will not quit
00:25:36.649 || 00:25:36.659 || spinning it's not the end but tougher
00:25:39.529 || 00:25:39.539 || times are ahead I'll guarantee it
00:25:41.210 || 00:25:41.220 || all right well David thank you so much

00:25:57.289 || 00:25:57.299 || probably your audience I think you have
00:26:00.350 || 00:26:00.360 || a younger viewership than I do uh if you
00:26:02.870 || 00:26:02.880 || go to the mortgagereport.com and hit the
00:26:06.409 || 00:26:06.419 || blog tab look up crypto conspiracy
00:26:08.690 || 00:26:08.700 || um volume 24.
00:26:10.789 || 00:26:10.799 || it's very enlightening this is stuff
00:26:12.590 || 00:26:12.600 || that was new information for me and I'm
00:26:14.269 || 00:26:14.279 || pretty steadied on this but it talks
00:26:15.950 || 00:26:15.960 || about what's going on with the bricks
00:26:17.870 || 00:26:17.880 || which everyone think is going to you
00:26:20.690 || 00:26:20.700 || know be gold back perhaps and it's a
00:26:23.269 || 00:26:23.279 || anti-dollar well what you find out from
00:26:25.730 || 00:26:25.740 || this video is that um that's not
00:26:27.830 || 00:26:27.840 || necessarily true so anyone that wants to
00:26:29.930 || 00:26:29.940 || see the future as far as where the
00:26:32.690 || 00:26:32.700 || system is being directed doesn't mean
00:26:34.370 || 00:26:34.380 || it'll get there but where it's being
00:26:36.830 || 00:26:36.840 || directed should watch crypto conspiracy
00:26:39.289 || 00:26:39.299 || number 24 and if you could say one more
00:26:40.850 || 00:26:40.860 || thing I will be speaking at the red pill
