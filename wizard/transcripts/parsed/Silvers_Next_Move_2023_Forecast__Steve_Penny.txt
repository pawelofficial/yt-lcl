00:00:15.650 || 00:00:15.660 || thank you so much for joining us today
00:00:17.570 || 00:00:17.580 || you bet Elijah thanks for inviting me
00:00:18.710 || 00:00:18.720 || back I'm looking forward to a good
00:00:19.670 || 00:00:19.680 || conversation
00:00:21.170 || 00:00:21.180 || well it's great to have you I've been
00:00:22.490 || 00:00:22.500 || wanting to have you on because you know
00:00:24.650 || 00:00:24.660 || we've seen this dramatic rise in the
00:00:26.689 || 00:00:26.699 || metals um it is kind of we're coming to
00:00:28.429 || 00:00:28.439 || the end of the year and looking back at
00:00:30.050 || 00:00:30.060 || the charts is kind of funny because you
00:00:31.910 || 00:00:31.920 || look at gold it made it made a huge run
00:00:33.950 || 00:00:33.960 || up and made a huge rundown and now we're
00:00:35.030 || 00:00:35.040 || pretty much where we were at the
00:00:36.650 || 00:00:36.660 || beginning of the year so
00:00:38.150 || 00:00:38.160 || um first your take on the recent rally
00:00:41.030 || 00:00:41.040 || we've seen in the last month or two
00:00:44.209 || 00:00:44.219 || um and then kind of this year and this
00:00:45.350 || 00:00:45.360 || year in review
00:00:47.330 || 00:00:47.340 || yeah you're right uh silver and gold
00:00:48.529 || 00:00:48.539 || looks like they're both going to end the
00:00:49.970 || 00:00:49.980 || year pretty pretty close to where they
00:00:52.190 || 00:00:52.200 || started but with a lot of volatility in
00:00:53.510 || 00:00:53.520 || between and that should that kind of
00:00:55.069 || 00:00:55.079 || shows when you look back this past year
00:00:57.950 || 00:00:57.960 || how volatility can be your friend if you
00:01:00.290 || 00:01:00.300 || are contrarian you know if you use those
00:01:03.529 || 00:01:03.539 || gut wrenching pullbacks to scale in and
00:01:05.149 || 00:01:05.159 || accumulate and uh you know if you're
00:01:06.649 || 00:01:06.659 || more short-term or oriented you could
00:01:08.690 || 00:01:08.700 || use those kind of rips to take a little
00:01:10.609 || 00:01:10.619 || bit of profits so volatility can be used
00:01:12.170 || 00:01:12.180 || to our advantage but I think we're
00:01:14.090 || 00:01:14.100 || setting up your very interesting and
00:01:16.490 || 00:01:16.500 || exciting 2023 especially for precious
00:01:18.170 || 00:01:18.180 || metals investors
00:01:19.730 || 00:01:19.740 || and if you did want to kind of share
00:01:21.649 || 00:01:21.659 || with us the charts of both gold and
00:01:23.210 || 00:01:23.220 || silver maybe starting with silver here
00:01:26.390 || 00:01:26.400 || and your outlook for 2023
00:01:28.070 || 00:01:28.080 || um you know coming this year
00:01:30.050 || 00:01:30.060 || yeah for sure so I'll go ahead and pull
00:01:32.390 || 00:01:32.400 || up a chart of silver here and you know
00:01:34.130 || 00:01:34.140 || if you're like me and your listeners are
00:01:35.990 || 00:01:36.000 || like me I'm getting sick and tired of
00:01:37.550 || 00:01:37.560 || like talking about the FED they'd get
00:01:40.130 || 00:01:40.140 || way too much way much more um you know
00:01:41.569 || 00:01:41.579 || air time than they should but
00:01:42.590 || 00:01:42.600 || unfortunately you know that's going to
00:01:45.289 || 00:01:45.299 || be the primary driver of most markets
00:01:47.210 || 00:01:47.220 || including the precious metals as we head
00:01:48.289 || 00:01:48.299 || into this year
00:01:51.410 || 00:01:51.420 || and you know uh there there's this kind
00:01:53.450 || 00:01:53.460 || of debate are is the Fed gonna pull a
00:01:55.370 || 00:01:55.380 || 180 or are they going to stick to their
00:01:57.770 || 00:01:57.780 || guns and raise hikes into a slowing
00:01:59.929 || 00:01:59.939 || economy and we could talk about that as
00:02:02.450 || 00:02:02.460 || well because it kind of is is relevant
00:02:04.249 || 00:02:04.259 || to this chart but when you just look at
00:02:07.130 || 00:02:07.140 || the chart this goes back to oh March of
00:02:09.469 || 00:02:09.479 || 2020. so there's the coveted low
00:02:11.150 || 00:02:11.160 || and you can see this rise that you you
00:02:12.470 || 00:02:12.480 || were just talking about we bought them
00:02:16.190 || 00:02:16.200 || here at uh 17.40 and made a high last
00:02:20.150 || 00:02:20.160 || week of 24.50 so that's a really nice
00:02:21.710 || 00:02:21.720 || run here in the last couple months in
00:02:23.570 || 00:02:23.580 || silver and we are getting overbought
00:02:25.070 || 00:02:25.080 || we're due for probably a short-term
00:02:27.710 || 00:02:27.720 || pullback but all indications do suggest
00:02:30.229 || 00:02:30.239 || that that the trend has changed we've
00:02:33.290 || 00:02:33.300 || seen higher highs higher lows and we're
00:02:35.690 || 00:02:35.700 || back above the uh key moving averages
00:02:37.250 || 00:02:37.260 || we're back above the 200-day moving
00:02:38.630 || 00:02:38.640 || average we're back above the 50-day
00:02:41.809 || 00:02:41.819 || moving average and when I zero in on a
00:02:47.449 || 00:02:47.459 || you can see this 50-day moving average
00:02:49.910 || 00:02:49.920 || has just bullishly crossed above the
00:02:51.470 || 00:02:51.480 || 200-day that's a bullish technical
00:02:53.509 || 00:02:53.519 || signal all of these things tend to put
00:02:55.250 || 00:02:55.260 || those algorithms that really Drive these
00:02:56.750 || 00:02:56.760 || markets especially the paper markets
00:02:58.670 || 00:02:58.680 || into a buy the dip mode as opposed to a
00:03:00.770 || 00:03:00.780 || sell the rally mode like we saw you know
00:03:03.350 || 00:03:03.360 || in much of 2022.
00:03:04.729 || 00:03:04.739 || um that said you know you can see we're
00:03:06.110 || 00:03:06.120 || getting a little bit overbought here and
00:03:07.729 || 00:03:07.739 || probably due for a pullback I would love
00:03:09.650 || 00:03:09.660 || to see a pullback towards this 200-day
00:03:11.750 || 00:03:11.760 || moving average that would be just a
00:03:13.610 || 00:03:13.620 || fantastic buying opportunity from my
00:03:15.649 || 00:03:15.659 || perspective that's all the way down at
00:03:19.490 || 00:03:19.500 || uh 21.29 right now not sure we'll get
00:03:21.229 || 00:03:21.239 || back that far but uh to be honest I'm
00:03:22.850 || 00:03:22.860 || kind of hoping for it just to kind of
00:03:24.830 || 00:03:24.840 || wash out some of this short-term
00:03:27.350 || 00:03:27.360 || specular speculative fervor and uh
00:03:29.030 || 00:03:29.040 || euphoria that we've seen just in the
00:03:30.589 || 00:03:30.599 || last few weeks
00:03:33.050 || 00:03:33.060 || and as for gold are you seeing a similar
00:03:35.690 || 00:03:35.700 || situation in there where it's overbought
00:03:37.970 || 00:03:37.980 || uh yeah but not not quite as much if you
00:03:39.410 || 00:03:39.420 || look at the gold silver ratio I'm not
00:03:41.030 || 00:03:41.040 || going to pull it up here just for
00:03:43.250 || 00:03:43.260 || Simplicity I can't be like me to but
00:03:44.990 || 00:03:45.000 || Silver's really outperform gold by a
00:03:46.490 || 00:03:46.500 || wide margin just in the past month or
00:03:48.770 || 00:03:48.780 || two that gold silver ratio got all the
00:03:51.710 || 00:03:51.720 || way to 96 to one uh just a few months
00:03:53.210 || 00:03:53.220 || ago and now it's compressed down into
00:03:55.309 || 00:03:55.319 || the 70s so silver has outperformed gold
00:03:57.830 || 00:03:57.840 || by a wide margin in a short period of
00:03:59.930 || 00:03:59.940 || time I think silver is still way
00:04:02.449 || 00:04:02.459 || undervalued relative to Gold but on a
00:04:03.710 || 00:04:03.720 || very short term basis you know it's
00:04:05.869 || 00:04:05.879 || moved really far really fast so I think
00:04:07.309 || 00:04:07.319 || silver is a little bit more overbought
00:04:09.110 || 00:04:09.120 || relative to Gold you can see gold is
00:04:10.490 || 00:04:10.500 || sitting here right hovering right along
00:04:12.589 || 00:04:12.599 || its uh 200-day moving average that's a
00:04:14.089 || 00:04:14.099 || nice consolidation pattern right along
00:04:16.430 || 00:04:16.440 || support uh that 50-day hasn't crossed
00:04:18.229 || 00:04:18.239 || above the 200 yet
00:04:20.569 || 00:04:20.579 || um but just like silver it does look
00:04:22.370 || 00:04:22.380 || like the trend has changed we see uh
00:04:24.290 || 00:04:24.300 || higher highs back above the 200-day
00:04:25.550 || 00:04:25.560 || moving average and things look
00:04:27.770 || 00:04:27.780 || constructed the cot reports for both
00:04:29.390 || 00:04:29.400 || silver and gold are still in bullish
00:04:30.950 || 00:04:30.960 || territory as well
00:04:33.890 || 00:04:33.900 || now you mentioned about uh you mentioned
00:04:35.629 || 00:04:35.639 || what the FED might be doing in the
00:04:37.730 || 00:04:37.740 || coming year it seems like you know we've
00:04:40.490 || 00:04:40.500 || seen quite a lot of rate hikes this year
00:04:43.670 || 00:04:43.680 || and dramatic rate hikes uh so what is
00:04:45.409 || 00:04:45.419 || your outlook for what the FED could do
00:04:47.749 || 00:04:47.759 || maybe a couple scenarios that you've
00:04:49.370 || 00:04:49.380 || thought through and how it could impact
00:04:51.650 || 00:04:51.660 || the markets sure what's happened here in
00:04:54.770 || 00:04:54.780 || 2022 really is unprecedented with the
00:04:56.749 || 00:04:56.759 || pace of change of you know this rate
00:04:59.150 || 00:04:59.160 || hike cycle uh we started in I think
00:05:01.610 || 00:05:01.620 || March of 2022 with the first 25 basis
00:05:04.730 || 00:05:04.740 || point hike and um you know they've hiked
00:05:06.110 || 00:05:06.120 || at every meeting since
00:05:08.689 || 00:05:08.699 || so there's a lot of like debate
00:05:10.010 || 00:05:10.020 || especially in the precious metals
00:05:11.090 || 00:05:11.100 || Community you know are they going to
00:05:12.890 || 00:05:12.900 || continue to tighten into a weakening
00:05:15.230 || 00:05:15.240 || economy or are they going to Pivot or
00:05:16.909 || 00:05:16.919 || pull a 180 and go back to debt
00:05:18.350 || 00:05:18.360 || monetization and lowering interest rates
00:05:20.510 || 00:05:20.520 || as the economy begins to weaken and the
00:05:21.950 || 00:05:21.960 || way I see it is there's three potential
00:05:24.290 || 00:05:24.300 || outcomes and you know I think it's very
00:05:25.909 || 00:05:25.919 || important that we Define our terms too
00:05:28.430 || 00:05:28.440 || you know uh the word pivot gets kind of
00:05:30.110 || 00:05:30.120 || thrown around all around a lot to me a
00:05:31.790 || 00:05:31.800 || pivot means like a slight change in
00:05:32.689 || 00:05:32.699 || Direction
00:05:35.270 || 00:05:35.280 || on the way towards a complete 180. so I
00:05:36.529 || 00:05:36.539 || think the pivot has already happened
00:05:41.270 || 00:05:41.280 || we've gone from 75 basis uh uh rate hike
00:05:43.730 || 00:05:43.740 || back to Now 50 and then it's expected to
00:05:46.010 || 00:05:46.020 || be 25 in February probably 25 in March
00:05:48.529 || 00:05:48.539 || uh until we eventually pause around five
00:05:50.749 || 00:05:50.759 || percent so I think the pivot the the
00:05:53.210 || 00:05:53.220 || easing has started to happen even though
00:05:55.129 || 00:05:55.139 || we haven't pulled the 180 yet so the
00:05:58.010 || 00:05:58.020 || kind of the three scenarios I see is one
00:06:00.230 || 00:06:00.240 || like what Powell's plan is uh you can
00:06:02.150 || 00:06:02.160 || even call a palace plan where he just
00:06:05.689 || 00:06:05.699 || kind of slowly uh uh you know gets that
00:06:07.610 || 00:06:07.620 || uh gets the interest rate up to around
00:06:09.710 || 00:06:09.720 || five to five and a quarter percent by
00:06:12.890 || 00:06:12.900 || May of 2023 and they call that the
00:06:16.010 || 00:06:16.020 || terminal rate and his goal is to get
00:06:19.010 || 00:06:19.020 || interest rates up to that uh that uh you
00:06:20.930 || 00:06:20.940 || know around five percent and then pause
00:06:22.909 || 00:06:22.919 || and then inflation naturally comes down
00:06:25.490 || 00:06:25.500 || on its own from there and you know that
00:06:27.350 || 00:06:27.360 || might sound good on paper but I think
00:06:28.730 || 00:06:28.740 || it's very unlikely that they can pull
00:06:30.950 || 00:06:30.960 || that off without breaking something uh
00:06:32.510 || 00:06:32.520 || the the other alternative is kind of
00:06:35.210 || 00:06:35.220 || like the soft Landing narrative that
00:06:37.550 || 00:06:37.560 || gets tossed around on social media or on
00:06:40.909 || 00:06:40.919 || mainstream um media I meant to say where
00:06:42.409 || 00:06:42.419 || yeah you know they kind of slow their
00:06:45.770 || 00:06:45.780 || rate hikes campaign eventually pause and
00:06:47.390 || 00:06:47.400 || we come in for like you know maybe a
00:06:49.730 || 00:06:49.740 || mild recession the last you know a few
00:06:52.010 || 00:06:52.020 || weeks and then or a few months and then
00:06:53.809 || 00:06:53.819 || we kind of you know go on your wife is
00:06:56.870 || 00:06:56.880 || going to life as normal that's kind of
00:06:58.430 || 00:06:58.440 || the I think the more generally accepted
00:07:00.409 || 00:07:00.419 || narrative but I think the most likely
00:07:02.150 || 00:07:02.160 || outcome is the third scenario here where
00:07:03.770 || 00:07:03.780 || they break something
00:07:07.370 || 00:07:07.380 || um in this process I think uh Powell has
00:07:09.469 || 00:07:09.479 || referenced Paul volcker several times
00:07:12.409 || 00:07:12.419 || now and it's obvious that he's studied
00:07:15.110 || 00:07:15.120 || you know bulker's mistakes and the way
00:07:18.230 || 00:07:18.240 || he um but you know uh beat inflation
00:07:21.589 || 00:07:21.599 || back in 1981. well a lot of us in the
00:07:22.850 || 00:07:22.860 || personnel's community kind of look back
00:07:24.050 || 00:07:24.060 || at Volker as the one who crushed
00:07:25.490 || 00:07:25.500 || inflation but we it's easy to forget
00:07:31.129 || 00:07:31.139 || that he took uh office in 1979 and there
00:07:33.589 || 00:07:33.599 || was a severe recession right into his
00:07:36.050 || 00:07:36.060 || first you know right right is he uh you
00:07:39.050 || 00:07:39.060 || know took that seat and he cut interest
00:07:41.210 || 00:07:41.220 || rates by like seven percent
00:07:44.689 || 00:07:44.699 || and that's when uh inflation spun out of
00:07:46.550 || 00:07:46.560 || control and then he had to raise
00:07:48.170 || 00:07:48.180 || interest rates even more aggressively
00:07:50.029 || 00:07:50.039 || and I think Powell does not want to make
00:07:51.290 || 00:07:51.300 || that same mistake so I think he's
00:07:52.490 || 00:07:52.500 || probably going to stick to his guns here
00:07:53.809 || 00:07:53.819 || and keep raising rates but I
00:07:55.010 || 00:07:55.020 || unfortunately think something's probably
00:07:56.870 || 00:07:56.880 || going to break we could see a you know
00:07:58.309 || 00:07:58.319 || some kind of liquidity crisis or
00:07:59.990 || 00:08:00.000 || something like that
00:08:02.270 || 00:08:02.280 || um it seems very likely in the coming
00:08:03.490 || 00:08:03.500 || months
00:08:06.230 || 00:08:06.240 || I know it's been said that when I know
00:08:08.390 || 00:08:08.400 || if I guess on the in the past and
00:08:10.610 || 00:08:10.620 || they've made the point that
00:08:13.850 || 00:08:13.860 || um the FED cannot control inflation by
00:08:16.010 || 00:08:16.020 || raising interest rates below the level
00:08:18.529 || 00:08:18.539 || of inflation so if even if the fed you
00:08:20.990 || 00:08:21.000 || know gets in uh interest rates to like
00:08:22.670 || 00:08:22.680 || five percent we're still seeing
00:08:24.950 || 00:08:24.960 || inflation above that so
00:08:26.689 || 00:08:26.699 || um it really does seem like the FED
00:08:29.749 || 00:08:29.759 || doesn't have any option because they
00:08:31.909 || 00:08:31.919 || can't get inflation get interest rates
00:08:34.250 || 00:08:34.260 || above that inflation rate
00:08:36.290 || 00:08:36.300 || yeah and it comes down to a little bit
00:08:37.550 || 00:08:37.560 || of semantics like how do you measure
00:08:39.949 || 00:08:39.959 || inflation you know real inflation the
00:08:41.389 || 00:08:41.399 || way you and I would look at it the way
00:08:43.850 || 00:08:43.860 || uh John Williams measures it using
00:08:45.230 || 00:08:45.240 || generally accepted accounting principles
00:08:46.850 || 00:08:46.860 || yeah inflation's still probably north of
00:08:49.430 || 00:08:49.440 || 10 well over 10 so they can't get the
00:08:50.990 || 00:08:51.000 || interest rate over 10 percent without
00:08:52.850 || 00:08:52.860 || just absolutely devastating the economy
00:08:54.590 || 00:08:54.600 || so it depends how you measure it and the
00:08:57.110 || 00:08:57.120 || fed's favorite tool is core pce and
00:08:58.550 || 00:08:58.560 || right now last I checked that's around
00:09:02.210 || 00:09:02.220 || uh I want to say 5.1 5.2 percent so it
00:09:04.490 || 00:09:04.500 || is possible that they get nominal rates
00:09:07.070 || 00:09:07.080 || above that core pce and then they can
00:09:08.509 || 00:09:08.519 || say hey we've got positive real interest
00:09:10.190 || 00:09:10.200 || rates even though in the real world
00:09:12.470 || 00:09:12.480 || that's not reality but you know it's
00:09:14.509 || 00:09:14.519 || possible they they do get uh the nominal
00:09:16.670 || 00:09:16.680 || rate above that core pce and then they
00:09:18.350 || 00:09:18.360 || say hey look we've got positive positive
00:09:19.850 || 00:09:19.860 || real rates here
00:09:22.430 || 00:09:22.440 || yeah and forgive me if I'm incorrect
00:09:24.470 || 00:09:24.480 || about this but I understand that that
00:09:26.870 || 00:09:26.880 || core pce is essentially taking away
00:09:28.550 || 00:09:28.560 || everything that people need to actually
00:09:31.130 || 00:09:31.140 || lift supporting fuel right yeah yeah
00:09:33.050 || 00:09:33.060 || it's like everything they do it's
00:09:34.850 || 00:09:34.860 || deceptive and it's not it's not right
00:09:37.910 || 00:09:37.920 || but that's they lie with Statistics they
00:09:39.410 || 00:09:39.420 || lie with numbers almost everything they
00:09:41.449 || 00:09:41.459 || say is not you know grounded in reality
00:09:44.509 || 00:09:44.519 || so you're exactly right it excludes uh
00:09:47.090 || 00:09:47.100 || you know housing prices excludes uh fuel
00:09:49.430 || 00:09:49.440 || they use owner's equivalent rent to all
00:09:52.430 || 00:09:52.440 || kinds of hedonics and you know uh the
00:09:54.769 || 00:09:54.779 || manipulation of Statistics now
00:09:56.389 || 00:09:56.399 || and I guess mentioning maybe those
00:09:58.070 || 00:09:58.080 || manipulation of Statistics we'll see if
00:10:00.170 || 00:10:00.180 || it applies here but if we look back at
00:10:03.110 || 00:10:03.120 || what they've done in 2022 on the surface
00:10:05.389 || 00:10:05.399 || it seems like oh maybe they have kind of
00:10:07.190 || 00:10:07.200 || accomplished the soft Landing we've we
00:10:09.230 || 00:10:09.240 || only see the stock market depending on
00:10:11.690 || 00:10:11.700 || which indices you're looking at 10 to 10
00:10:13.670 || 00:10:13.680 || to 30 percent down and we've got
00:10:15.889 || 00:10:15.899 || interest interest rates above four
00:10:17.509 || 00:10:17.519 || percent for the FED funds rate so that's
00:10:20.630 || 00:10:20.640 || and we're you know slightly uh coming
00:10:23.930 || 00:10:23.940 || down on inflation so it seems like they
00:10:26.690 || 00:10:26.700 || are kind of maneuvering and you know
00:10:28.970 || 00:10:28.980 || getting us this soft Landing if you look
00:10:30.829 || 00:10:30.839 || at kind of the mainstream numbers there
00:10:33.470 || 00:10:33.480 || but your perspective on that yeah it's
00:10:35.570 || 00:10:35.580 || uh uh Jim Sinclair used to call it mope
00:10:37.550 || 00:10:37.560 || or management of perspective economics
00:10:39.530 || 00:10:39.540 || uh I know you've had Bill halter on your
00:10:41.930 || 00:10:41.940 || program too who uh works with him and
00:10:43.190 || 00:10:43.200 || he's used that same
00:10:46.430 || 00:10:46.440 || uh acronym mope but anyway the idea is
00:10:49.009 || 00:10:49.019 || if you can get convince the public that
00:10:51.050 || 00:10:51.060 || of the narrative you know the idea is
00:10:52.310 || 00:10:52.320 || that reality won't matter as much
00:10:54.410 || 00:10:54.420 || unfortunately reality always matters at
00:10:55.370 || 00:10:55.380 || some point
00:10:57.230 || 00:10:57.240 || but yeah can they convince the public
00:10:59.150 || 00:10:59.160 || that they've they've you know they've
00:11:02.210 || 00:11:02.220 || met maneuvered a soft Landing here uh to
00:11:04.069 || 00:11:04.079 || me very unlikely I mean reality is going
00:11:05.990 || 00:11:06.000 || to set in and probably in in the early
00:11:09.350 || 00:11:09.360 || part of 2023 is what I'm expected
00:11:11.630 || 00:11:11.640 || now when it comes to I guess the
00:11:14.210 || 00:11:14.220 || precious metal markets in light of what
00:11:16.130 || 00:11:16.140 || the FED may do you're saying they've
00:11:18.170 || 00:11:18.180 || really already pivoted because they've
00:11:20.150 || 00:11:20.160 || changed direction right they're going to
00:11:22.490 || 00:11:22.500 || lower um they're going to they're
00:11:24.590 || 00:11:24.600 || decreasing the rate of increase right
00:11:25.490 || 00:11:25.500 || now
00:11:28.550 || 00:11:28.560 || um so as we look into 2023 how do you
00:11:30.470 || 00:11:30.480 || see the metals markets being impacted by
00:11:32.449 || 00:11:32.459 || the fed's decisions
00:11:35.269 || 00:11:35.279 || yeah it's it's I'll be honest so I deal
00:11:37.190 || 00:11:37.200 || in probabilities not predictions right
00:11:38.990 || 00:11:39.000 || and I can see a variety of potential
00:11:42.050 || 00:11:42.060 || outcomes all of them resulting in metals
00:11:43.730 || 00:11:43.740 || being Higher by the end of the year it's
00:11:45.889 || 00:11:45.899 || just the path that we take to get there
00:11:49.370 || 00:11:49.380 || so my Baseline scenario is that the
00:11:51.530 || 00:11:51.540 || markets are forward-looking and they're
00:11:53.449 || 00:11:53.459 || going to anticipate this pause and I see
00:11:55.790 || 00:11:55.800 || a rally into that pause
00:11:58.310 || 00:11:58.320 || but I don't think they pull a 180 which
00:11:59.870 || 00:11:59.880 || some people call a pivot where they go
00:12:01.130 || 00:12:01.140 || back to debt monetization lowering
00:12:03.170 || 00:12:03.180 || interest rates until something breaks I
00:12:04.370 || 00:12:04.380 || think that's what's going to be the
00:12:05.930 || 00:12:05.940 || Catalyst for them to go back into that
00:12:07.610 || 00:12:07.620 || monetization and that's when we see the
00:12:10.310 || 00:12:10.320 || really big short moves in uh silver and
00:12:12.050 || 00:12:12.060 || gold and I think that's probably going
00:12:14.329 || 00:12:14.339 || to happen in 2023 it's hard for me to
00:12:15.590 || 00:12:15.600 || foresee a scenario where it doesn't
00:12:18.110 || 00:12:18.120 || actually so uh I think the metals move
00:12:20.329 || 00:12:20.339 || higher anticipating the pause something
00:12:22.490 || 00:12:22.500 || probably breaks they may react you know
00:12:24.829 || 00:12:24.839 || uh negatively like a lot of asset
00:12:26.509 || 00:12:26.519 || classes in a you know short-term record
00:12:28.250 || 00:12:28.260 || of the event but I think those monetary
00:12:29.930 || 00:12:29.940 || spigots get turned on faster than
00:12:31.850 || 00:12:31.860 || anything we've ever seen before and
00:12:34.370 || 00:12:34.380 || that's when the metals go uh ballistic
00:12:36.050 || 00:12:36.060 || to the upside
00:12:39.050 || 00:12:39.060 || now this year not only in the medals
00:12:40.550 || 00:12:40.560 || prices medals prices have been very
00:12:42.530 || 00:12:42.540 || volatile but we're also seeing in the
00:12:45.230 || 00:12:45.240 || physical Market just extremes that
00:12:46.730 || 00:12:46.740 || really we haven't seen before I guess
00:12:49.670 || 00:12:49.680 || maybe you know back in uh when kovitz
00:12:50.810 || 00:12:50.820 || first started and then also during
00:12:53.449 || 00:12:53.459 || silver squeeze but we've just seen uh
00:12:56.030 || 00:12:56.040 || huge premiums uh an increase in premiums
00:12:58.610 || 00:12:58.620 || and shortages and supplies
00:13:00.590 || 00:13:00.600 || um a few months ago we were seeing one
00:13:02.750 || 00:13:02.760 || of the major wholesalers in the U.S
00:13:04.790 || 00:13:04.800 || essentially almost completely out of
00:13:07.129 || 00:13:07.139 || physical product now physical Supply is
00:13:09.829 || 00:13:09.839 || coming back uh in a bit so premiums are
00:13:11.870 || 00:13:11.880 || dropping as the spot price has gone up
00:13:13.910 || 00:13:13.920 || but we've just seen this extreme
00:13:16.730 || 00:13:16.740 || volatility of you know a lot of bullying
00:13:18.710 || 00:13:18.720 || dealers including miles Franklin you
00:13:20.389 || 00:13:20.399 || know saying are we going to be able to
00:13:23.030 || 00:13:23.040 || Source product uh in the future do you
00:13:25.430 || 00:13:25.440 || anticipate that I guess volatility in
00:13:28.190 || 00:13:28.200 || the physical availability and premiums
00:13:32.269 || 00:13:32.279 || continuing in 2023. uh yeah I do I'm not
00:13:34.490 || 00:13:34.500 || an expert in you know more about this
00:13:36.170 || 00:13:36.180 || than I do the short-term retail demand
00:13:37.550 || 00:13:37.560 || and how premiums are affected and
00:13:39.230 || 00:13:39.240 || everything but yeah that was historic
00:13:40.910 || 00:13:40.920 || premium so we saw earlier this year and
00:13:42.710 || 00:13:42.720 || they're still high and I do think
00:13:44.389 || 00:13:44.399 || there's going to come a point not
00:13:46.370 || 00:13:46.380 || necessarily in 2023 but it's possible
00:13:49.009 || 00:13:49.019 || but in the coming handful of years where
00:13:50.389 || 00:13:50.399 || people will want to get their hand on
00:13:51.949 || 00:13:51.959 || visible metal silver and gold and they
00:13:54.170 || 00:13:54.180 || won't be able to and I think of like
00:13:55.730 || 00:13:55.740 || Venezuela right now you know how many of
00:13:57.170 || 00:13:57.180 || those poor people would love to get
00:13:58.790 || 00:13:58.800 || their trade some fiat currency that's
00:14:00.590 || 00:14:00.600 || just being debased on a massive scale
00:14:02.690 || 00:14:02.700 || for some physical metal they can't it's
00:14:04.790 || 00:14:04.800 || not it's not an option for them so the
00:14:06.470 || 00:14:06.480 || idea is to use volatility to your
00:14:08.269 || 00:14:08.279 || advantage uh dollar cost average maybe
00:14:10.009 || 00:14:10.019 || increase your dollar cost averaging when
00:14:11.870 || 00:14:11.880 || you know there's these sharp pullbacks
00:14:13.190 || 00:14:13.200 || because I believe there's going to come
00:14:14.870 || 00:14:14.880 || a time where you can't get it and it
00:14:16.730 || 00:14:16.740 || also it kind of highlights you know over
00:14:18.829 || 00:14:18.839 || on our on our website some of our
00:14:20.629 || 00:14:20.639 || members were asking if you're seeing a
00:14:22.250 || 00:14:22.260 || short-term pullback here in the medals
00:14:24.769 || 00:14:24.779 || you know why not sell some or sell all
00:14:27.110 || 00:14:27.120 || of it and then buy back cheaper and the
00:14:28.990 || 00:14:29.000 || risk with that is if you get too cute
00:14:32.590 || 00:14:32.600 || that the it just runs away without you
00:14:36.470 || 00:14:36.480 || so and eventually the physical Market is
00:14:37.269 || 00:14:37.279 || gonna
00:14:39.949 || 00:14:39.959 || be where price is set and the comex is
00:14:41.090 || 00:14:41.100 || going to become less relevant or
00:14:43.310 || 00:14:43.320 || irrelevant so you know there's coming a
00:14:45.650 || 00:14:45.660 || day where the price is set by phys by
00:14:47.810 || 00:14:47.820 || demand uh supply and demand fundamentals
00:14:49.129 || 00:14:49.139 || of the physical Market not these paper
00:14:51.350 || 00:14:51.360 || contracts that can be issued at will by
00:14:53.509 || 00:14:53.519 || uh you know the commas
00:14:55.310 || 00:14:55.320 || yeah I mean the funny thing that I've
00:14:57.470 || 00:14:57.480 || noticed as we're you know selling
00:14:59.870 || 00:14:59.880 || bullion is as the premium is coming down
00:15:01.730 || 00:15:01.740 || the spot price is going up and I'm
00:15:03.470 || 00:15:03.480 || looking at the prices that you know
00:15:05.449 || 00:15:05.459 || clients were charging clients for the
00:15:08.150 || 00:15:08.160 || product sign is like and often what we
00:15:09.829 || 00:15:09.839 || have to pay for the products as well a
00:15:11.750 || 00:15:11.760 || lot of this uh the raising premiums and
00:15:13.490 || 00:15:13.500 || the decrease in premiums are coming from
00:15:15.350 || 00:15:15.360 || the wholesalers as well but it's
00:15:18.170 || 00:15:18.180 || interesting because what's happening is
00:15:21.889 || 00:15:21.899 || you know maybe you're paying 28.29 for a
00:15:24.050 || 00:15:24.060 || silver coin but two months ago when the
00:15:27.050 || 00:15:27.060 || spot price was way lower people were
00:15:29.210 || 00:15:29.220 || paying that much and for the silver
00:15:30.769 || 00:15:30.779 || product as well and for Silver Eagles
00:15:32.930 || 00:15:32.940 || you know you're still having to pay 35
00:15:35.629 || 00:15:35.639 || 36 dollars today when silver was 18
00:15:37.430 || 00:15:37.440 || that's how much you're having to pay so
00:15:39.410 || 00:15:39.420 || it's like it's so funny where it's like
00:15:42.110 || 00:15:42.120 || if you try to time the market a lot of
00:15:44.449 || 00:15:44.459 || the time because of this volatility and
00:15:46.430 || 00:15:46.440 || premiums it's not actually going to work
00:15:48.650 || 00:15:48.660 || it's the the question is going to come
00:15:51.050 || 00:15:51.060 || down to in a lot of circumstances can
00:15:52.430 || 00:15:52.440 || you actually get the physical product
00:15:54.050 || 00:15:54.060 || and for what price because the physical
00:15:55.850 || 00:15:55.860 || Market is completely different it seems
00:15:58.550 || 00:15:58.560 || like at least in recent history yeah I
00:16:01.430 || 00:16:01.440 || think anything like sub 21 silver 22
00:16:03.230 || 00:16:03.240 || Silver you know any further price
00:16:04.850 || 00:16:04.860 || decline in the paper price if you're
00:16:06.050 || 00:16:06.060 || looking to accumulate physical it's
00:16:07.370 || 00:16:07.380 || probably just going to be offset by a
00:16:10.250 || 00:16:10.260 || rise an equal rise in the premium so the
00:16:12.470 || 00:16:12.480 || bottom line it's it's it's really hard
00:16:14.269 || 00:16:14.279 || to get visible silver for less than like
00:16:16.370 || 00:16:16.380 || 22 dollars I mean even if the spot price
00:16:18.050 || 00:16:18.060 || Falls to you know back to where it was
00:16:20.329 || 00:16:20.339 || in the 17s
00:16:23.389 || 00:16:23.399 || and one of the questions here is also on
00:16:25.910 || 00:16:25.920 || the physical side we're looking at a lot
00:16:27.590 || 00:16:27.600 || of physical silver being drained from
00:16:29.389 || 00:16:29.399 || the major exchanges we have a viewer
00:16:32.090 || 00:16:32.100 || wanting to know your perspective on that
00:16:34.910 || 00:16:34.920 || um do you think the comex or lbma won't
00:16:36.590 || 00:16:36.600 || be able to
00:16:39.470 || 00:16:39.480 || um deliver due to availability uh your
00:16:40.730 || 00:16:40.740 || perspective on that
00:16:42.769 || 00:16:42.779 || yeah how I look at that I've
00:16:44.329 || 00:16:44.339 || I've been in this market for about 15
00:16:45.530 || 00:16:45.540 || years I know you've been in this
00:16:47.329 || 00:16:47.339 || following the pressure smells market for
00:16:49.189 || 00:16:49.199 || years as well and this has kind of been
00:16:51.050 || 00:16:51.060 || a continuing theme for probably 10 plus
00:16:52.850 || 00:16:52.860 || years you know the comex is going to
00:16:54.290 || 00:16:54.300 || default or the lbm is going to default
00:16:55.610 || 00:16:55.620 || and I believe that is going to happen
00:16:57.650 || 00:16:57.660 || but trying to predict the timing has
00:16:59.810 || 00:16:59.820 || been many people have predicted that
00:17:01.129 || 00:17:01.139 || probably there's been hundreds of
00:17:02.930 || 00:17:02.940 || predictions from very small people the
00:17:04.669 || 00:17:04.679 || comex is going to default I think it's
00:17:06.169 || 00:17:06.179 || probably going to happen but I don't
00:17:08.990 || 00:17:09.000 || like uh make short-term investment
00:17:11.329 || 00:17:11.339 || decisions around that to me it's just
00:17:12.949 || 00:17:12.959 || something that's like a potential upside
00:17:14.990 || 00:17:15.000 || kicker of all the reasons to invest in
00:17:18.549 || 00:17:18.559 || silver you know the main ones are
00:17:20.569 || 00:17:20.579 || debasement of currency and then you've
00:17:22.370 || 00:17:22.380 || got these upside kickers where if the
00:17:23.990 || 00:17:24.000 || comex defaults I mean that would just be
00:17:26.329 || 00:17:26.339 || a tremendous upside kicker but I don't
00:17:29.090 || 00:17:29.100 || uh I watch it it's interesting uh open
00:17:32.030 || 00:17:32.040 || interest even in uh in the Futures
00:17:33.890 || 00:17:33.900 || market right now is like at like I think
00:17:36.049 || 00:17:36.059 || 10-year lows in silver and gold is way
00:17:37.430 || 00:17:37.440 || down there too
00:17:39.169 || 00:17:39.179 || um so these are interesting developments
00:17:41.450 || 00:17:41.460 || but I don't make short-term investment
00:17:43.250 || 00:17:43.260 || decisions around
00:17:45.049 || 00:17:45.059 || now I did want to get your perspective
00:17:49.490 || 00:17:49.500 || also on the General Market in 2022 this
00:17:51.890 || 00:17:51.900 || year we have seen a lot of volatility up
00:17:53.810 || 00:17:53.820 || and down in the stock market a lot of
00:17:54.890 || 00:17:54.900 || people were thinking that the stock
00:17:57.110 || 00:17:57.120 || market was going to crash that may still
00:17:59.150 || 00:17:59.160 || happen it seems like we may just kind of
00:18:01.970 || 00:18:01.980 || be in a in a phase where it's kind of a
00:18:04.070 || 00:18:04.080 || dead cat bounce right now but we are
00:18:06.529 || 00:18:06.539 || seeing in some of the indices you know a
00:18:08.630 || 00:18:08.640 || higher high being made so I wanted to
00:18:10.549 || 00:18:10.559 || get your perspective on the stock market
00:18:13.970 || 00:18:13.980 || and what you see for it in uh 2023. sure
00:18:15.710 || 00:18:15.720 || so for this one it might be beneficial
00:18:16.909 || 00:18:16.919 || to go ahead and share my screen if
00:18:18.289 || 00:18:18.299 || that's all right with you Elijah that's
00:18:19.730 || 00:18:19.740 || perfect I'm going to go ahead and pull
00:18:21.830 || 00:18:21.840 || up a weekly chart of the S P 500 and
00:18:23.210 || 00:18:23.220 || I'll share my screen here in just a
00:18:25.310 || 00:18:25.320 || moment so you can see this very clear
00:18:27.650 || 00:18:27.660 || red downtrend line goes back to the
00:18:31.070 || 00:18:31.080 || highs of uh the stock market peaked in
00:18:33.230 || 00:18:33.240 || January of uh this current year January
00:18:36.049 || 00:18:36.059 || 2022 and we've just made a series of
00:18:38.090 || 00:18:38.100 || lower highs going all the way back all
00:18:38.990 || 00:18:39.000 || year long
00:18:40.870 || 00:18:40.880 || I call this um
00:18:43.430 || 00:18:43.440 || I Look to take short positions every
00:18:45.169 || 00:18:45.179 || time we test this line you know I short
00:18:47.750 || 00:18:47.760 || it here shorted here shorted here didn't
00:18:49.370 || 00:18:49.380 || short on this one and I'm kicking myself
00:18:51.590 || 00:18:51.600 || works we got three red candles but this
00:18:53.630 || 00:18:53.640 || this red line coincides with the 200-day
00:18:55.130 || 00:18:55.140 || moving average so I'm going to go to a
00:19:00.650 || 00:19:00.660 || and you can see how closely this red
00:19:02.630 || 00:19:02.640 || line coincides with that yellow 200 day
00:19:04.490 || 00:19:04.500 || and we've talked about before how
00:19:06.950 || 00:19:06.960 || algorithms tend to be in a Cell the
00:19:08.690 || 00:19:08.700 || rally mode below a declining 200-day
00:19:10.070 || 00:19:10.080 || moving average and that's also the
00:19:11.630 || 00:19:11.640 || simplest definition of a downtrend so
00:19:14.390 || 00:19:14.400 || stocks will remain in a downtrend and
00:19:15.830 || 00:19:15.840 || you know the trend is down until it
00:19:17.690 || 00:19:17.700 || isn't if we break convincingly
00:19:20.210 || 00:19:20.220 || convincingly back above that 200-day we
00:19:21.529 || 00:19:21.539 || could start saying hey maybe stocks are
00:19:22.970 || 00:19:22.980 || going to rally
00:19:24.169 || 00:19:24.179 || um
00:19:26.090 || 00:19:26.100 || as far as
00:19:28.370 || 00:19:28.380 || here's here's my outlook for General
00:19:30.950 || 00:19:30.960 || equities Baseline roadmap I think when
00:19:33.830 || 00:19:33.840 || the FED pauses and eventually does a 180
00:19:37.490 || 00:19:37.500 || General equities will most likely see a
00:19:38.990 || 00:19:39.000 || really nice pop as well whether they go
00:19:41.210 || 00:19:41.220 || make new all-time highs I don't know
00:19:43.130 || 00:19:43.140 || but there's always the risk and I think
00:19:44.750 || 00:19:44.760 || this day is coming too one of these
00:19:47.150 || 00:19:47.160 || times the FED is going to print money
00:19:48.289 || 00:19:48.299 || they're going to turn on the monetary
00:19:50.390 || 00:19:50.400 || spigots and eventually it's not going to
00:19:51.710 || 00:19:51.720 || work they're not going to get the
00:19:53.990 || 00:19:54.000 || desired outcome uh maybe uh interest
00:19:55.250 || 00:19:55.260 || rates are kind of running away to the
00:19:56.270 || 00:19:56.280 || upside and they want to bring interest
00:19:57.650 || 00:19:57.660 || rates down and they want to kind of
00:19:59.870 || 00:19:59.880 || boost the stock market a little bit and
00:20:02.690 || 00:20:02.700 || so they uh you know prints money debt do
00:20:04.010 || 00:20:04.020 || more debt monetization and they don't
00:20:05.990 || 00:20:06.000 || get the desired result
00:20:07.970 || 00:20:07.980 || um so that's why I I kind of steer clear
00:20:10.190 || 00:20:10.200 || of General equities for right now and
00:20:12.710 || 00:20:12.720 || you know that's why you know hard assets
00:20:14.450 || 00:20:14.460 || present the most favorable risk reward
00:20:17.029 || 00:20:17.039 || ratio over the next handful of years I
00:20:19.430 || 00:20:19.440 || think the rest of this decade really
00:20:21.950 || 00:20:21.960 || I can't remember the exact term if it's
00:20:24.350 || 00:20:24.360 || this a silent crash the stock market has
00:20:26.870 || 00:20:26.880 || gone through before where it's like you
00:20:28.789 || 00:20:28.799 || have inflation but the stock market just
00:20:30.950 || 00:20:30.960 || goes sideways and it seems like that's
00:20:33.470 || 00:20:33.480 || definitely a situation we could uh have
00:20:35.390 || 00:20:35.400 || If the Fed you know goes back to
00:20:38.510 || 00:20:38.520 || monetary uh the easy monetary policy and
00:20:40.010 || 00:20:40.020 || then the stock market just doesn't react
00:20:42.230 || 00:20:42.240 || to that you know it's going down in real
00:20:45.049 || 00:20:45.059 || value at that time exactly I there was
00:20:46.669 || 00:20:46.679 || it last year the year before Venezuela
00:20:48.350 || 00:20:48.360 || had the best performing stock market in
00:20:50.150 || 00:20:50.160 || the world but of course you know that's
00:20:52.430 || 00:20:52.440 || in nominal terms it didn't preserve
00:20:53.870 || 00:20:53.880 || purchasing power in the way you know
00:20:55.549 || 00:20:55.559 || hard assets did especially silver and
00:20:57.470 || 00:20:57.480 || gold but you could see a scenario where
00:20:58.970 || 00:20:58.980 || stocks double but everything else
00:21:00.950 || 00:21:00.960 || quadruples well good stocks doubled or
00:21:02.990 || 00:21:03.000 || did they go down by half and I would
00:21:04.549 || 00:21:04.559 || argue they went down by half relative to
00:21:05.750 || 00:21:05.760 || everything else even though the nominal
00:21:07.430 || 00:21:07.440 || value might go up
00:21:09.110 || 00:21:09.120 || um so that's that's where ratio charts
00:21:11.390 || 00:21:11.400 || are so powerful because they removed the
00:21:13.310 || 00:21:13.320 || dollar from the equation and you're just
00:21:15.049 || 00:21:15.059 || measuring one thing against another
00:21:17.570 || 00:21:17.580 || thing and you can really find where the
00:21:20.029 || 00:21:20.039 || value is and on that note to try with
00:21:22.850 || 00:21:22.860 || you uh I'd love to I'd love to show this
00:21:24.169 || 00:21:24.179 || um
00:21:28.130 || 00:21:28.140 || uh silver to Dow ratio chart which
00:21:29.570 || 00:21:29.580 || because if I if I didn't show the chart
00:21:31.490 || 00:21:31.500 || it would almost sound like I'm just a
00:21:32.649 || 00:21:32.659 || you know
00:21:35.390 || 00:21:35.400 || like it's a internet hype kind of trying
00:21:36.830 || 00:21:36.840 || to get clicks or whatever because it's
00:21:38.990 || 00:21:39.000 || almost unbelievable
00:21:41.090 || 00:21:41.100 || but this is just data this is uh
00:21:42.830 || 00:21:42.840 || happened over
00:21:44.930 || 00:21:44.940 || um over and over in history
00:21:46.549 || 00:21:46.559 || and like I said it would sound
00:21:48.590 || 00:21:48.600 || Sensational if I didn't have a chart to
00:21:50.750 || 00:21:50.760 || show you if if we were to go back to
00:21:52.430 || 00:21:52.440 || where we were in 1980 silver would
00:21:55.610 || 00:21:55.620 || outperform the Dow by a factor of 50.
00:21:57.409 || 00:21:57.419 || um like I said might sound Sensational
00:21:58.789 || 00:21:58.799 || but that's just data that's happened
00:22:00.770 || 00:22:00.780 || before uh could it happen again I think
00:22:02.330 || 00:22:02.340 || it's very likely to to be honest with
00:22:04.070 || 00:22:04.080 || you over the next you know handful years
00:22:06.230 || 00:22:06.240 || not necessarily in 2023 but I think
00:22:08.570 || 00:22:08.580 || we'll get back to this ratio at some
00:22:10.549 || 00:22:10.559 || point this decade and that shows where
00:22:12.049 || 00:22:12.059 || the value is and it's interesting too
00:22:14.090 || 00:22:14.100 || this the pattern that this ratio chart
00:22:16.549 || 00:22:16.559 || is forming I drew these lines a couple
00:22:19.490 || 00:22:19.500 || years ago or at least a year ago I drew
00:22:21.070 || 00:22:21.080 || them a long time ago and it's
00:22:23.390 || 00:22:23.400 || interesting to see how well prices
00:22:25.610 || 00:22:25.620 || respected these lines and once we get a
00:22:27.230 || 00:22:27.240 || breakout above this downtrend line that
00:22:29.029 || 00:22:29.039 || goes back to 2011 so this is like a
00:22:31.070 || 00:22:31.080 || 10-year downtrend line that's where I
00:22:32.510 || 00:22:32.520 || would really look for silver to begin to
00:22:35.750 || 00:22:35.760 || outperform in general equities and once
00:22:37.730 || 00:22:37.740 || the metals begin outperforming stocks
00:22:39.409 || 00:22:39.419 || that's when you're going to get a lot of
00:22:40.970 || 00:22:40.980 || the attention of those generalist
00:22:43.310 || 00:22:43.320 || investors when institutional money
00:22:45.470 || 00:22:45.480 || starts piling in those aren't
00:22:46.610 || 00:22:46.620 || necessarily the people who are looking
00:22:48.890 || 00:22:48.900 || for hyperinflation and you know all
00:22:50.090 || 00:22:50.100 || these kind of things that your audience
00:22:51.649 || 00:22:51.659 || is familiar with they're just looking
00:22:53.450 || 00:22:53.460 || for relative outperformance And when
00:22:55.130 || 00:22:55.140 || they see the metals outperforming stocks
00:22:57.649 || 00:22:57.659 || that's going to be um I think it's
00:22:58.669 || 00:22:58.679 || really going to catch their attention
00:23:01.370 || 00:23:01.380 || and be a Tailwind for us
00:23:03.230 || 00:23:03.240 || before we let you go Steve if you could
00:23:04.370 || 00:23:04.380 || kind of share with our viewers again
00:23:06.169 || 00:23:06.179 || kind of the price points you're looking
00:23:08.810 || 00:23:08.820 || for in both gold and silver if you could
00:23:10.190 || 00:23:10.200 || share those charts I know we have a lot
00:23:12.230 || 00:23:12.240 || more viewers who have joined since we
00:23:13.730 || 00:23:13.740 || looked at those at the top of the
00:23:15.350 || 00:23:15.360 || interview so if you wouldn't mind just
00:23:16.789 || 00:23:16.799 || sharing that again for our viewers
00:23:18.049 || 00:23:18.059 || absolutely yeah I'll just go to a daily
00:23:21.350 || 00:23:21.360 || chart for silver here yeah 2453 was the
00:23:22.850 || 00:23:22.860 || high from a few days ago
00:23:25.250 || 00:23:25.260 || I think we're probably uh getting a
00:23:26.690 || 00:23:26.700 || little bit stretched here so due for a
00:23:28.190 || 00:23:28.200 || pullback that would be healthy to work
00:23:29.870 || 00:23:29.880 || off some of the speculative froth that's
00:23:32.149 || 00:23:32.159 || come in over the last few weeks initial
00:23:34.250 || 00:23:34.260 || support is at the lower rail of this uh
00:23:36.289 || 00:23:36.299 || sharp uptrend channel here wouldn't be
00:23:38.210 || 00:23:38.220 || surprised if this gave way and we pulled
00:23:40.190 || 00:23:40.200 || back towards the 50-day and the 200-day
00:23:42.529 || 00:23:42.539 || that's currently dinner on 21.50 not
00:23:44.750 || 00:23:44.760 || sure we get back quite that far but I'm
00:23:46.250 || 00:23:46.260 || hoping for it because that would be a
00:23:48.110 || 00:23:48.120 || really nice buying opportunity work off
00:23:51.409 || 00:23:51.419 || this RSI it would turn the cot back to
00:23:53.690 || 00:23:53.700 || being extremely bullish again
00:23:55.909 || 00:23:55.919 || um you know that those speculative the
00:23:58.250 || 00:23:58.260 || momentum chasing chasing speculators
00:24:00.049 || 00:24:00.059 || would be washed out so looking for a
00:24:01.970 || 00:24:01.980 || pullback hopefully towards just below 22
00:24:03.950 || 00:24:03.960 || between let's call between 21 and 22 and
00:24:05.090 || 00:24:05.100 || silver
00:24:07.549 || 00:24:07.559 || uh for for gold it's not as overbought
00:24:08.990 || 00:24:09.000 || as silver it's sitting right at its
00:24:11.270 || 00:24:11.280 || 200-day moving average
00:24:12.950 || 00:24:12.960 || um optimistic that this support right
00:24:16.430 || 00:24:16.440 || here at about 1790 to 1800 will hold if
00:24:18.169 || 00:24:18.179 || it doesn't you've got this 50-day moving
00:24:19.549 || 00:24:19.559 || average that's moving up quickly down
00:24:22.909 || 00:24:22.919 || around 1740. so-called 1740 to 1750
00:24:25.130 || 00:24:25.140 || initial support on gold and I think any
00:24:27.230 || 00:24:27.240 || pullbacks to those areas will be really
00:24:29.570 || 00:24:29.580 || good buying opportunities for both
00:24:30.950 || 00:24:30.960 || short-term Traders and longer term
