00:00:02.570 || 00:00:02.580 || hey everyone this is Elijah K Johnson
00:00:04.850 || 00:00:04.860 || with liberty and finance and back with
00:00:06.170 || 00:00:06.180 || us today is our good friend Robert
00:00:08.629 || 00:00:08.639 || Keynes from gold silver Pros Robert
00:00:10.009 || 00:00:10.019 || thank you so much for joining us today
00:00:11.810 || 00:00:11.820 || thanks for having me on Elijah it's my
00:00:14.450 || 00:00:14.460 || pleasure well it's great to have you and
00:00:16.730 || 00:00:16.740 || I'd like to discuss the wild week we've
00:00:19.189 || 00:00:19.199 || had in the precious metal markets
00:00:20.990 || 00:00:21.000 || um your take on what we've seen pretty
00:00:23.090 || 00:00:23.100 || much what I'm hearing is that you know
00:00:25.070 || 00:00:25.080 || Powell made a speech and signaled that
00:00:26.810 || 00:00:26.820 || there might be a slowing of the rate
00:00:29.150 || 00:00:29.160 || hikes um so your perspective on
00:00:31.009 || 00:00:31.019 || everything that we've seen this week
00:00:33.229 || 00:00:33.239 || yeah so I do think the FED has kind of
00:00:34.910 || 00:00:34.920 || been signaling that given what's going
00:00:36.350 || 00:00:36.360 || on in the markets they may be willing to
00:00:37.850 || 00:00:37.860 || slow down their rate hikes a little bit
00:00:39.170 || 00:00:39.180 || I don't think that they're going to
00:00:41.030 || 00:00:41.040 || fully pivot and and stop doing rate
00:00:42.470 || 00:00:42.480 || hikes
00:00:45.049 || 00:00:45.059 || um but I do think that they may try like
00:00:47.510 || 00:00:47.520 || a half a point next time uh as they get
00:00:49.610 || 00:00:49.620 || closer to their you know five percentage
00:00:50.869 || 00:00:50.879 || points that they think that they want
00:00:53.029 || 00:00:53.039 || and then you know if Powell and the FED
00:00:55.010 || 00:00:55.020 || hold true to that which you can't really
00:00:56.389 || 00:00:56.399 || hold them to it because every time that
00:00:57.709 || 00:00:57.719 || they do an interest rate hike or
00:00:58.790 || 00:00:58.800 || something along those lines you got to
00:01:01.010 || 00:01:01.020 || see how the economy reacts so what they
00:01:02.389 || 00:01:02.399 || do first is they throw out their trial
00:01:03.889 || 00:01:03.899 || balloons you know we've been having the
00:01:05.929 || 00:01:05.939 || FED speak a couple of people spoke last
00:01:08.330 || 00:01:08.340 || week a couple of people spoke this week
00:01:10.370 || 00:01:10.380 || uh and they're I think they trial
00:01:12.350 || 00:01:12.360 || balloon some things they talk about some
00:01:14.030 || 00:01:14.040 || things they kind of see how people react
00:01:16.250 || 00:01:16.260 || to that and then of course you know when
00:01:18.170 || 00:01:18.180 || when they have the big one pal speaks
00:01:19.550 || 00:01:19.560 || and
00:01:21.410 || 00:01:21.420 || hopefully by that time they prepare
00:01:23.690 || 00:01:23.700 || people maybe for what's coming and then
00:01:25.249 || 00:01:25.259 || they see what happens you know and when
00:01:26.749 || 00:01:26.759 || they raise interest rates depending on
00:01:29.030 || 00:01:29.040 || you know the severity and direction of
00:01:31.490 || 00:01:31.500 || the move uh you know and then the
00:01:33.230 || 00:01:33.240 || economic data they're getting they'll do
00:01:35.090 || 00:01:35.100 || it again so at the end of the day nobody
00:01:37.190 || 00:01:37.200 || really knows uh what they're going to do
00:01:38.390 || 00:01:38.400 || at any given point time because I don't
00:01:40.310 || 00:01:40.320 || think that they do I think they have
00:01:41.870 || 00:01:41.880 || their Dot Plot and I think they have
00:01:43.550 || 00:01:43.560 || their scenario basically Dot Plot is
00:01:45.830 || 00:01:45.840 || like a scenario for decision analysis
00:01:47.390 || 00:01:47.400 || type of system so depending on what
00:01:50.030 || 00:01:50.040 || happens they may go this way or they may
00:01:52.550 || 00:01:52.560 || go that way but I do think that as they
00:01:55.550 || 00:01:55.560 || get closer their five percentage Point
00:01:57.609 || 00:01:57.619 || um yeah their five percentage Point goal
00:02:00.469 || 00:02:00.479 || and uh federal funds right I do you know
00:02:01.550 || 00:02:01.560 || it'd be interesting to see where the
00:02:02.749 || 00:02:02.759 || economy is because every time they raise
00:02:04.190 || 00:02:04.200 || an interest rate they're creating a lot
00:02:06.350 || 00:02:06.360 || more interest expense and it's making it
00:02:08.389 || 00:02:08.399 || harder for companies across the economy
00:02:10.609 || 00:02:10.619 || tomorrow of course it makes it uh harder
00:02:12.530 || 00:02:12.540 || for people to borrow as well it makes it
00:02:14.510 || 00:02:14.520 || harder for homeowners and what we've
00:02:16.790 || 00:02:16.800 || seen Elijah this week and last week
00:02:18.710 || 00:02:18.720 || there was a ton of data that came out on
00:02:20.990 || 00:02:21.000 || the housing sector on the auto sector
00:02:23.630 || 00:02:23.640 || both of those are retracing
00:02:25.970 || 00:02:25.980 || um that the housing sector moderated a
00:02:26.990 || 00:02:27.000 || little bit this month but it's still
00:02:28.790 || 00:02:28.800 || negative so it's still not growing it's
00:02:30.170 || 00:02:30.180 || pulling back
00:02:32.030 || 00:02:32.040 || and you can see on this big big ticket
00:02:33.949 || 00:02:33.959 || purchase items the consumers aren't
00:02:35.990 || 00:02:36.000 || buying as much I will say this though
00:02:38.030 || 00:02:38.040 || the early Returns on Black Friday were
00:02:38.990 || 00:02:39.000 || pretty good
00:02:41.449 || 00:02:41.459 || we did have a good consumer sales season
00:02:43.490 || 00:02:43.500 || there online especially bricks and
00:02:45.890 || 00:02:45.900 || mortar didn't do quite as well so we'll
00:02:48.229 || 00:02:48.239 || follow uh this is the big you know
00:02:51.350 || 00:02:51.360 || potential uh consumer recovery the last
00:02:53.089 || 00:02:53.099 || couple of months a year it's when you
00:02:54.589 || 00:02:54.599 || know people come out and they do their
00:02:55.850 || 00:02:55.860 || holiday shopping and they do their
00:02:58.309 || 00:02:58.319 || travel and and all of those things their
00:03:00.350 || 00:03:00.360 || get-togethers for for New Year's and for
00:03:02.449 || 00:03:02.459 || Christmas so we'll see how that goes you
00:03:03.470 || 00:03:03.480 || know we'll have that data by early
00:03:05.270 || 00:03:05.280 || January and we'll see you know did the
00:03:08.589 || 00:03:08.599 || consumer basically save 2022 for retail
00:03:12.830 || 00:03:12.840 || I suspect we'll have maybe modest growth
00:03:15.729 || 00:03:15.739 || in consumer spend this year probably
00:03:19.970 || 00:03:19.980 || under CPI so it means net of CPI we
00:03:22.610 || 00:03:22.620 || actually may not have had a lot of
00:03:24.830 || 00:03:24.840 || growth in consumer demand but we'll have
00:03:26.030 || 00:03:26.040 || to see how that goes but definitely the
00:03:27.710 || 00:03:27.720 || big ticket items right now housing
00:03:29.449 || 00:03:29.459 || Automotive people are already pulling
00:03:30.649 || 00:03:30.659 || back and they have been for two to three
00:03:32.630 || 00:03:32.640 || months
00:03:35.149 || 00:03:35.159 || no I I have been pretty surprised
00:03:37.190 || 00:03:37.200 || actually at the rise in in the metals I
00:03:39.410 || 00:03:39.420 || mean obviously there are so many bullish
00:03:41.270 || 00:03:41.280 || fundamentals here but I mean the it's
00:03:42.710 || 00:03:42.720 || been really dramatic it was only a month
00:03:45.289 || 00:03:45.299 || or so ago right we had like 18 silver an
00:03:47.210 || 00:03:47.220 || hour above 23.
00:03:49.490 || 00:03:49.500 || um why do you think there's been such a
00:03:51.710 || 00:03:51.720 || dramatic rise and very consistent we
00:03:54.229 || 00:03:54.239 || really haven't seen much of a pullback
00:03:57.530 || 00:03:57.540 || um since you know since the 18 uh point
00:03:59.690 || 00:03:59.700 || yeah I think the rise has been sort of a
00:04:01.910 || 00:04:01.920 || Confluence of different factors so one
00:04:04.369 || 00:04:04.379 || of the big obvious ones is you know what
00:04:07.250 || 00:04:07.260 || the FED says the second one if we go
00:04:09.949 || 00:04:09.959 || directly to the gold markets is the
00:04:12.470 || 00:04:12.480 || trade December is always a big trade and
00:04:14.690 || 00:04:14.700 || delivery month for Gold and Silver now
00:04:17.210 || 00:04:17.220 || most of the open interest on the comex
00:04:18.710 || 00:04:18.720 || derivative markets has actually moved
00:04:20.629 || 00:04:20.639 || off into February and into March for
00:04:22.250 || 00:04:22.260 || gold and silver and so December is not
00:04:25.129 || 00:04:25.139 || such a big month but we do see uh the
00:04:26.749 || 00:04:26.759 || last couple of days of the month
00:04:29.050 || 00:04:29.060 || previous you can
00:04:32.330 || 00:04:32.340 || file your intent to take delivery of the
00:04:34.249 || 00:04:34.259 || medal so starting about November 30th
00:04:35.870 || 00:04:35.880 || and then the first couple of days of
00:04:38.629 || 00:04:38.639 || December uh people can file their notice
00:04:40.850 || 00:04:40.860 || to take delivery and we've had Fairly
00:04:42.350 || 00:04:42.360 || substantial deliveries we'll talk about
00:04:45.830 || 00:04:45.840 || uh what's over here we're up to 26 185
00:04:47.870 || 00:04:47.880 || contracts of 5 000 so we're in the first
00:04:49.610 || 00:04:49.620 || three days it's not overwhelming but
00:04:51.409 || 00:04:51.419 || certainly a fair amount goal we've had a
00:04:53.510 || 00:04:53.520 || little bit more we're up to almost 12
00:04:55.490 || 00:04:55.500 || 000 contracts standing for delivery and
00:04:57.290 || 00:04:57.300 || on the very first day November 29th that
00:04:59.090 || 00:04:59.100 || you can Stanford December delivery there
00:05:02.150 || 00:05:02.160 || were 6 100 contracts so we've had some
00:05:04.610 || 00:05:04.620 || fairly robust demand for gold the the
00:05:06.350 || 00:05:06.360 || fiscal demand for silver deliveries on
00:05:08.150 || 00:05:08.160 || comex has been okay it's been about
00:05:10.550 || 00:05:10.560 || middle of the road for for this year
00:05:12.290 || 00:05:12.300 || certainly not I think what a lot of
00:05:13.730 || 00:05:13.740 || people have expected but there were
00:05:16.189 || 00:05:16.199 || enough deliveries that I think it did it
00:05:17.930 || 00:05:17.940 || does affect people's View
00:05:20.810 || 00:05:20.820 || on the markets I also think one of the
00:05:25.870 || 00:05:25.880 || big ones is FTX so FTX and uh
00:05:28.249 || 00:05:28.259 || uh some of those exchanges and lenders
00:05:29.390 || 00:05:29.400 || in the crypto world are really
00:05:31.610 || 00:05:31.620 || experiencing problems and with FTX in
00:05:33.230 || 00:05:33.240 || particular it was basically like a
00:05:36.050 || 00:05:36.060 || multi-level Ponzi because FTX would go
00:05:37.670 || 00:05:37.680 || in and look at players in the market
00:05:39.529 || 00:05:39.539 || that needed loans and as long as they
00:05:42.170 || 00:05:42.180 || you know had some cash and Equity FTX
00:05:46.850 || 00:05:46.860 || would loan money uh and a lot of that
00:05:49.490 || 00:05:49.500 || investment went bad as the crypto Market
00:05:51.590 || 00:05:51.600 || you know crashed I mean we had 60 000
00:05:53.810 || 00:05:53.820 || Bitcoin now we're down to a lot less
00:05:55.730 || 00:05:55.740 || than that we're not I think we just hit
00:05:59.270 || 00:05:59.280 || over 17 000 today at Bitcoin so so the
00:06:01.129 || 00:06:01.139 || market and crypto is not robust that
00:06:03.469 || 00:06:03.479 || caused a lot of the exchanges uh to
00:06:04.730 || 00:06:04.740 || start to fail especially if they were
00:06:08.390 || 00:06:08.400 || also lenders and FTX in particular every
00:06:10.730 || 00:06:10.740 || time they got they received money they
00:06:14.450 || 00:06:14.460 || basically uh lent it out to Almeda
00:06:15.950 || 00:06:15.960 || which and put in a lot of risky
00:06:17.150 || 00:06:17.160 || investment and that's essentially what
00:06:19.550 || 00:06:19.560 || happened so FTX busted and there's a lot
00:06:21.590 || 00:06:21.600 || of worries about repercussions from FTX
00:06:23.749 || 00:06:23.759 || is the contingent gone in the crypto
00:06:25.610 || 00:06:25.620 || Market is there more and I think that's
00:06:27.290 || 00:06:27.300 || rattled people because crypto's been
00:06:30.290 || 00:06:30.300 || such you know a big part of
00:06:32.270 || 00:06:32.280 || uh people's investment and finance the
00:06:33.469 || 00:06:33.479 || last 10 years especially the last few
00:06:35.330 || 00:06:35.340 || years there's tons of money that that
00:06:37.430 || 00:06:37.440 || went into crypto and a lot of people
00:06:39.529 || 00:06:39.539 || credit crypto with maybe taking a lot of
00:06:42.290 || 00:06:42.300 || the the funds away from the mining
00:06:43.850 || 00:06:43.860 || sector and from the gold and silver
00:06:46.550 || 00:06:46.560 || bullion I think now that crypto's had
00:06:48.170 || 00:06:48.180 || you know its sort of big liquidation
00:06:50.689 || 00:06:50.699 || movement this year people are moving uh
00:06:52.129 || 00:06:52.139 || more of their money into gold and silver
00:06:54.469 || 00:06:54.479 || and so we see very healthy demand from a
00:06:56.570 || 00:06:56.580 || fiscal standpoint and I think if you add
00:06:59.270 || 00:06:59.280 || some of those factors up along with uh
00:07:00.890 || 00:07:00.900 || like I said the the consumer that's
00:07:03.350 || 00:07:03.360 || starting to flag a little bit here in
00:07:04.610 || 00:07:04.620 || the second half of the year due to the
00:07:07.010 || 00:07:07.020 || to the vet interest rate Rises all of
00:07:09.050 || 00:07:09.060 || that really is pushing people more into
00:07:10.909 || 00:07:10.919 || Safe Haven assets and I think that's why
00:07:12.350 || 00:07:12.360 || gold and silver are doing fairly well
00:07:14.809 || 00:07:14.819 || last thing I would like to say we've
00:07:16.550 || 00:07:16.560 || been tracking the last couple months
00:07:19.370 || 00:07:19.380 || silver specifically the bullion Banks
00:07:21.050 || 00:07:21.060 || and I consider the bullion Banks pretty
00:07:22.249 || 00:07:22.259 || much to be the leader of the direction
00:07:23.749 || 00:07:23.759 || of where that's going to go because they
00:07:26.450 || 00:07:26.460 || have the most data uh with their housing
00:07:28.550 || 00:07:28.560 || customer accounts and they know what all
00:07:30.469 || 00:07:30.479 || the positioning is and they really pay
00:07:32.689 || 00:07:32.699 || attention to the physical market and the
00:07:34.129 || 00:07:34.139 || bullion banks have gone that long silver
00:07:35.930 || 00:07:35.940 || here for the last couple of three months
00:07:37.969 || 00:07:37.979 || and so I think they're expecting the
00:07:39.230 || 00:07:39.240 || price to rise and I think what that's
00:07:40.730 || 00:07:40.740 || done is to remove some of the short
00:07:42.469 || 00:07:42.479 || pressure off of that silver market so
00:07:44.689 || 00:07:44.699 || Silver's probably benefited you know a
00:07:46.550 || 00:07:46.560 || little bit more than gold has but this
00:07:49.010 || 00:07:49.020 || both certainly benefit from the end of
00:07:51.050 || 00:07:51.060 || the year derivative trading I'm sorry I
00:07:52.670 || 00:07:52.680 || said last point I have one more for you
00:07:56.150 || 00:07:56.160 || uh the love trade so India China a lot
00:07:58.010 || 00:07:58.020 || of that area of the world buys a lot of
00:07:59.150 || 00:07:59.160 || physical gold and silver this time of
00:08:01.850 || 00:08:01.860 || year for weddings for anniversaries for
00:08:05.570 || 00:08:05.580 || dowries for a lot of celebrations and so
00:08:07.909 || 00:08:07.919 || and also a lot of people buy it at the
00:08:09.469 || 00:08:09.479 || end of the year for savings as they
00:08:11.990 || 00:08:12.000 || prepare for 2023. so there's been a lot
00:08:13.850 || 00:08:13.860 || of movement off of the Shanghai market
00:08:17.510 || 00:08:17.520 || in gold and silver deliveries in fact I
00:08:19.430 || 00:08:19.440 || believe in October the Shanghai report
00:08:22.010 || 00:08:22.020 || had about twice as much silver
00:08:24.529 || 00:08:24.539 || deliveries on the Shanghai as you
00:08:26.330 || 00:08:26.340 || typically see in a given month so far in
00:08:28.129 || 00:08:28.139 || 2022 so definitely at the end of the
00:08:29.809 || 00:08:29.819 || year people are not only going to comex
00:08:31.790 || 00:08:31.800 || in London to get their physical medals
00:08:33.409 || 00:08:33.419 || are also going over to China and I think
00:08:36.350 || 00:08:36.360 || that worldwide Global physical demand is
00:08:37.969 || 00:08:37.979 || putting you know is Butcher seeing the
00:08:38.870 || 00:08:38.880 || price I'm putting a little bit of a
00:08:40.850 || 00:08:40.860 || floor here and I think that's good gold
00:08:43.070 || 00:08:43.080 || is really challenging uh resistance
00:08:45.590 || 00:08:45.600 || points at 1800 Silver's pop through the
00:08:47.449 || 00:08:47.459 || 22 dollar resistance point which has
00:08:50.269 || 00:08:50.279 || been just so hard for it to stay above
00:08:52.370 || 00:08:52.380 || uh this year and so those are all
00:08:53.810 || 00:08:53.820 || positive developments and from a
00:08:55.370 || 00:08:55.380 || technical perspective and so I think the
00:08:56.509 || 00:08:56.519 || people should be very happy with what's
00:08:57.829 || 00:08:57.839 || going on in gold and silver I think it's
00:08:58.810 || 00:08:58.820 || been great
00:09:01.490 || 00:09:01.500 || no I was gonna ask you kind of the
00:09:03.110 || 00:09:03.120 || forecast you have for precious metals
00:09:04.310 || 00:09:04.320 || going into the end of the year and
00:09:06.170 || 00:09:06.180 || further um we have a viewer question
00:09:09.530 || 00:09:09.540 || here about uh if we have a recession
00:09:12.110 || 00:09:12.120 || coming possibly in the spring what how
00:09:14.389 || 00:09:14.399 || that could impact Metals prices your
00:09:15.710 || 00:09:15.720 || perspective on that
00:09:17.090 || 00:09:17.100 || yeah I do think we're headed to a
00:09:18.590 || 00:09:18.600 || recession if you look at the yield curve
00:09:20.150 || 00:09:20.160 || it's been inverted for several months
00:09:22.750 || 00:09:22.760 || now that usually predicts a recession
00:09:25.490 || 00:09:25.500 || somewhere between 6 and 18 months on
00:09:26.810 || 00:09:26.820 || average it's done at seven or eight
00:09:27.769 || 00:09:27.779 || times in history that we've been
00:09:29.509 || 00:09:29.519 || following it and the yield curve in
00:09:30.949 || 00:09:30.959 || version is when you look at the 10-year
00:09:33.110 || 00:09:33.120 || bond and the two-year Bond when the
00:09:35.389 || 00:09:35.399 || two-year Bond or the shorter term bond
00:09:37.610 || 00:09:37.620 || demands more yield it means people are
00:09:39.350 || 00:09:39.360 || saying there's more risk right now than
00:09:41.150 || 00:09:41.160 || there is 10 years from now that's
00:09:42.710 || 00:09:42.720 || backward from typical because if you
00:09:43.910 || 00:09:43.920 || think about it
00:09:46.610 || 00:09:46.620 || most people would think or assume that
00:09:48.050 || 00:09:48.060 || they're able to gauge risk tears out
00:09:50.090 || 00:09:50.100 || better than 10. so when you're demanding
00:09:52.190 || 00:09:52.200 || more yield and more risk for in the
00:09:53.449 || 00:09:53.459 || two-year time frame it means we're
00:09:55.970 || 00:09:55.980 || expecting a recession so I and if you
00:09:57.650 || 00:09:57.660 || look at GDP this year the first two
00:09:59.150 || 00:09:59.160 || quarters were negative I think we had a
00:10:01.730 || 00:10:01.740 || negative 1.6 and a negative 0.6 now it
00:10:04.190 || 00:10:04.200 || looks like GDP GDP for third quarter was
00:10:05.570 || 00:10:05.580 || positive and it looks like for fourth
00:10:07.850 || 00:10:07.860 || quarter it's trending positive we had
00:10:10.070 || 00:10:10.080 || some data out on that this week so it's
00:10:12.230 || 00:10:12.240 || not a lot though if you decrement it for
00:10:15.290 || 00:10:15.300 || inflation you're really not growing all
00:10:17.750 || 00:10:17.760 || that much so you know it depends on how
00:10:19.070 || 00:10:19.080 || you slice the numbers statistics are
00:10:20.329 || 00:10:20.339 || wonderful you manipulate them however
00:10:23.210 || 00:10:23.220 || you want net of everything cost
00:10:25.190 || 00:10:25.200 || inflation everything we're not growing
00:10:26.690 || 00:10:26.700 || right now in fact we're probably
00:10:31.009 || 00:10:31.019 || shrinking a fair amount and so I think
00:10:33.889 || 00:10:33.899 || from a nominal perspectively in
00:10:36.350 || 00:10:36.360 || recession right now no but from a real
00:10:38.509 || 00:10:38.519 || perspective when you talk about interest
00:10:41.509 || 00:10:41.519 || rates and inflation yes we are and so I
00:10:43.970 || 00:10:43.980 || think we're already there but I also if
00:10:46.130 || 00:10:46.140 || you look at what's going on
00:10:47.930 || 00:10:47.940 || with a lot of the analysts Bank of
00:10:49.730 || 00:10:49.740 || America Goldman Sachs these guys are
00:10:52.069 || 00:10:52.079 || coming out with reports that say things
00:10:54.530 || 00:10:54.540 || like we expect rolling shock waves to
00:10:57.350 || 00:10:57.360 || the economy in 2023 we expect a
00:11:00.170 || 00:11:00.180 || worsening depression some of the big uh
00:11:02.569 || 00:11:02.579 || commercial Banks uh U.S commercial well
00:11:03.769 || 00:11:03.779 || actually global commercial Banks now
00:11:05.269 || 00:11:05.279 || that do business in the US they're not
00:11:08.030 || 00:11:08.040 || us-based anymore a lot of those banks
00:11:09.829 || 00:11:09.839 || are basically saying yeah normally we're
00:11:10.910 || 00:11:10.920 || going to have recession but we're
00:11:13.790 || 00:11:13.800 || expecting some fairly big volatile
00:11:15.650 || 00:11:15.660 || movements in the economy it's going to
00:11:17.329 || 00:11:17.339 || go up it's going to go down and when you
00:11:18.769 || 00:11:18.779 || get to that point Elijah what that's
00:11:21.230 || 00:11:21.240 || signifying is stresses in the economy
00:11:23.030 || 00:11:23.040 || leading to something bigger think about
00:11:24.769 || 00:11:24.779 || it as like a pre-shot to an earthquake
00:11:26.569 || 00:11:26.579 || uh sometimes you get the little baby
00:11:28.430 || 00:11:28.440 || shocks and then you get the big one and
00:11:29.990 || 00:11:30.000 || I think what's happening is we're seeing
00:11:31.490 || 00:11:31.500 || the baby shocks right now with data we
00:11:34.310 || 00:11:34.320 || see in 2022 with GDP and inflation and
00:11:36.290 || 00:11:36.300 || the FED having to react with raising the
00:11:38.150 || 00:11:38.160 || federal funds rate but I think the big
00:11:40.190 || 00:11:40.200 || one's coming and if you listen to some
00:11:41.449 || 00:11:41.459 || of the big commercial Banks they think
00:11:45.110 || 00:11:45.120 || 2023 that's entirely possible I mean it
00:11:46.970 || 00:11:46.980 || could happen we'll just have to kind of
00:11:49.130 || 00:11:49.140 || stay tuned to the economy for for you
00:11:51.470 || 00:11:51.480 || know for any big shocks to come a big
00:11:53.509 || 00:11:53.519 || bank failure
00:11:55.310 || 00:11:55.320 || um one of these Sovereign National
00:11:57.889 || 00:11:57.899 || economies really suffering from high and
00:12:00.050 || 00:12:00.060 || higher inflation say more than double
00:12:02.329 || 00:12:02.339 || digit if we see somebody get you know a
00:12:04.009 || 00:12:04.019 || pretty big size getting like 20 or 30
00:12:06.350 || 00:12:06.360 || percent and I think the area you really
00:12:07.850 || 00:12:07.860 || have to look at the two areas I'm
00:12:09.769 || 00:12:09.779 || following from a G from a geographical
00:12:12.769 || 00:12:12.779 || perspective are the UK
00:12:14.569 || 00:12:14.579 || because of what happened where they had
00:12:17.690 || 00:12:17.700 || that big shock to their economy they
00:12:19.009 || 00:12:19.019 || ousted their prime minister after only
00:12:21.889 || 00:12:21.899 || 44 45 days and they're really kind of
00:12:23.870 || 00:12:23.880 || suffering but Europe is a biggie because
00:12:25.490 || 00:12:25.500 || Elijah what's happening right now they
00:12:27.470 || 00:12:27.480 || don't have energy security and if
00:12:29.389 || 00:12:29.399 || Germany shuts down if they can't
00:12:31.310 || 00:12:31.320 || manufacture you could see that entire
00:12:34.310 || 00:12:34.320 || Eurozone going to a very very deep
00:12:36.769 || 00:12:36.779 || recession very very quickly and I think
00:12:38.829 || 00:12:38.839 || that Europe is probably going to go
00:12:41.150 || 00:12:41.160 || deeper into recession before the US does
00:12:42.710 || 00:12:42.720 || I think another Canada as well as Japan
00:12:44.150 || 00:12:44.160 || and I wrote about both of these 10 years
00:12:47.449 || 00:12:47.459 || ago I said probably either Euro Japan is
00:12:49.730 || 00:12:49.740 || going to kick off the next big financial
00:12:52.009 || 00:12:52.019 || crisis and I think both of those are
00:12:53.990 || 00:12:54.000 || feasible but given the energy situation
00:12:55.550 || 00:12:55.560 || that's developed this year I think
00:12:57.769 || 00:12:57.779 || Europe could be the first to go and I I
00:12:59.150 || 00:12:59.160 || really worry about the European people
00:13:00.110 || 00:13:00.120 || I'm not even worried about their
00:13:01.430 || 00:13:01.440 || financial system I'm worried about the
00:13:02.870 || 00:13:02.880 || ability of them to heat their homes they
00:13:04.550 || 00:13:04.560 || can get very cold there in certain areas
00:13:06.889 || 00:13:06.899 || hopefully they've stocked up on wooden
00:13:09.230 || 00:13:09.240 || heating oil certainly a lot of Europe
00:13:11.509 || 00:13:11.519 || has shut down their nuclear Germany shut
00:13:13.490 || 00:13:13.500 || down a lot of their plants starting them
00:13:15.769 || 00:13:15.779 || is not quite so easy they're relying on
00:13:18.170 || 00:13:18.180 || coal they're relying on France natural
00:13:20.690 || 00:13:20.700 || gas supplies hopefully those come those
00:13:23.030 || 00:13:23.040 || things come to fruition and Europe will
00:13:25.129 || 00:13:25.139 || be okay this winter but if Europe goes
00:13:26.810 || 00:13:26.820 || down severely it's going to affect the
00:13:27.889 || 00:13:27.899 || rest of it doesn't pull the entire world
00:13:30.230 || 00:13:30.240 || into recession essentially
00:13:31.970 || 00:13:31.980 || now for our viewers just joining us now
00:13:33.710 || 00:13:33.720 || we're live here with Robert Kings of
00:13:36.290 || 00:13:36.300 || gold silver Pros Rob I did want to ask
00:13:39.710 || 00:13:39.720 || you more kind of about uh your outlook
00:13:41.150 || 00:13:41.160 || for precious metals and a recession
00:13:44.750 || 00:13:44.760 || because it seems like when we've seen
00:13:46.670 || 00:13:46.680 || it's kind of interesting how we
00:13:50.269 || 00:13:50.279 || sometimes see gold and silver rise
00:13:52.250 || 00:13:52.260 || during a recession sometimes they fall
00:13:55.250 || 00:13:55.260 || during a recession and often they're
00:13:57.590 || 00:13:57.600 || correlated and sometimes reversed to the
00:14:00.050 || 00:14:00.060 || stock market sometimes uh go up with the
00:14:02.030 || 00:14:02.040 || stock market so what are the key
00:14:04.910 || 00:14:04.920 || catalysts we need to be looking for to
00:14:06.769 || 00:14:06.779 || indicate that if we are heading into a
00:14:08.449 || 00:14:08.459 || recession precious metals are actually
00:14:11.090 || 00:14:11.100 || going to be rising this time so the key
00:14:14.269 || 00:14:14.279 || thing to remember about spot price is it
00:14:16.610 || 00:14:16.620 || is a derivative traded paper price it
00:14:19.370 || 00:14:19.380 || does not reflect market supply and
00:14:21.230 || 00:14:21.240 || demand fundamentals so the number one
00:14:22.370 || 00:14:22.380 || thing if you want to know where precious
00:14:23.930 || 00:14:23.940 || metals are going to go in 2023 you
00:14:26.569 || 00:14:26.579 || basically check three things one the fed
00:14:28.250 || 00:14:28.260 || and interest rates two the world
00:14:30.170 || 00:14:30.180 || economies and are they hitting the skids
00:14:31.730 || 00:14:31.740 || because that'll push people into the
00:14:34.250 || 00:14:34.260 || precious metals and three you look at
00:14:35.810 || 00:14:35.820 || the actual physical trait the physical
00:14:39.110 || 00:14:39.120 || trait is so strong that at some point
00:14:41.269 || 00:14:41.279 || that has got to push the derivative
00:14:43.189 || 00:14:43.199 || markets up we've got a little bit of ubu
00:14:44.750 || 00:14:44.760 || a boost here in December because it's a
00:14:46.850 || 00:14:46.860 || big delivery month and that happens and
00:14:48.110 || 00:14:48.120 || you have some other things pushing that
00:14:50.569 || 00:14:50.579 || up but really for 2023
00:14:52.430 || 00:14:52.440 || look at the recession look at how the
00:14:55.250 || 00:14:55.260 || FED reacts who goes in recession first
00:14:57.829 || 00:14:57.839 || probably the big a company it's going to
00:15:00.530 || 00:15:00.540 || recession first is Europe and it may
00:15:02.829 || 00:15:02.839 || pull some of those guys down with them
00:15:04.970 || 00:15:04.980 || Russia's in pretty good shape China's
00:15:07.069 || 00:15:07.079 || not in the hottest shape so look at
00:15:09.769 || 00:15:09.779 || those factors and then look at how the
00:15:12.350 || 00:15:12.360 || FED reacts to all that it the FED cannot
00:15:15.290 || 00:15:15.300 || control worldwide recessions all they
00:15:17.750 || 00:15:17.760 || can do is react if if we go into a
00:15:20.090 || 00:15:20.100 || worldwide recession will five percentage
00:15:21.769 || 00:15:21.779 || points be enough for the FED to work
00:15:23.810 || 00:15:23.820 || with to ease and kind of I don't think
00:15:25.430 || 00:15:25.440 || it's going to be Elijah not with the
00:15:27.829 || 00:15:27.839 || amount of debt that we have not with the
00:15:29.449 || 00:15:29.459 || depth of the issues we have with energy
00:15:30.530 || 00:15:30.540 || security
00:15:33.170 || 00:15:33.180 || I it I just don't see this as being like
00:15:35.750 || 00:15:35.760 || last time so I think 2023 really is
00:15:38.569 || 00:15:38.579 || going to be one of those very volatile
00:15:41.509 || 00:15:41.519 || years you're going to see markets really
00:15:44.269 || 00:15:44.279 || uh pop up and fall down I think you can
00:15:47.329 || 00:15:47.339 || see 100 moves in the gold price uh on a
00:15:49.310 || 00:15:49.320 || daily basis or at least over a couple of
00:15:51.829 || 00:15:51.839 || days you could see uh four three four
00:15:53.870 || 00:15:53.880 || five dollar moves in silver I mean high
00:15:56.269 || 00:15:56.279 || percentage points you could see Bitcoin
00:15:58.430 || 00:15:58.440 || explode at some point you know go up to
00:16:00.829 || 00:16:00.839 || 30 40 50 60 000 and then come back down
00:16:03.590 || 00:16:03.600 || and I think the frequency at which we
00:16:05.090 || 00:16:05.100 || see some of these violent price action
00:16:07.370 || 00:16:07.380 || Moves In in various markets including
00:16:09.470 || 00:16:09.480 || stocks and bonds as well is probably
00:16:11.750 || 00:16:11.760 || going to increase and then I think as we
00:16:13.550 || 00:16:13.560 || get near the end of 2023 in the picture
00:16:16.129 || 00:16:16.139 || about the world economy comes clear
00:16:18.470 || 00:16:18.480 || and the central banks have all rested on
00:16:20.389 || 00:16:20.399 || their tightening programs the second
00:16:22.430 || 00:16:22.440 || half of 2023 is critical because then
00:16:24.170 || 00:16:24.180 || you'll have a couple of company earnings
00:16:26.569 || 00:16:26.579 || reports out there you'll know where
00:16:28.610 || 00:16:28.620 || you're going on inflation and I think
00:16:30.290 || 00:16:30.300 || more than likely in the second half of
00:16:31.990 || 00:16:32.000 || 2023
00:16:34.129 || 00:16:34.139 || probably you know after people get back
00:16:35.689 || 00:16:35.699 || from summer I think you're going to see
00:16:37.249 || 00:16:37.259 || some bigger movements in gold and silver
00:16:40.310 || 00:16:40.320 || but for the first half of 2023 watch
00:16:42.710 || 00:16:42.720 || those economic numbers and watch what
00:16:44.150 || 00:16:44.160 || the fed the rest of central banks do
00:16:45.949 || 00:16:45.959 || with their quantitative tightening
00:16:47.870 || 00:16:47.880 || programs they tighten too much that'll
00:16:49.970 || 00:16:49.980 || pop gold and silver and then of course
00:16:52.310 || 00:16:52.320 || if we run out somewhere we're down to
00:16:54.650 || 00:16:54.660 || not a whole lot of free silver so silver
00:16:56.930 || 00:16:56.940 || silver could break the mold this time
00:16:59.629 || 00:16:59.639 || because typically gold and silver go up
00:17:01.009 || 00:17:01.019 || at the same time gold will lead
00:17:03.470 || 00:17:03.480 || typically but given the supply shortages
00:17:05.210 || 00:17:05.220 || and silver we could see a reversal of
00:17:06.710 || 00:17:06.720 || that script we could see silver pulling
00:17:09.650 || 00:17:09.660 || up gold it's entirely possible uh and
00:17:12.169 || 00:17:12.179 || we'll just have to follow that trade
00:17:14.150 || 00:17:14.160 || you mentioned at the at the beginning of
00:17:15.770 || 00:17:15.780 || the answer to that question about the
00:17:17.329 || 00:17:17.339 || physical demand and I know at Miles
00:17:19.730 || 00:17:19.740 || Franklin here we've been seeing a huge
00:17:22.490 || 00:17:22.500 || physical demand it's let up a bit in the
00:17:23.990 || 00:17:24.000 || last month or so
00:17:25.669 || 00:17:25.679 || um but your perspective on physical
00:17:28.010 || 00:17:28.020 || Demand right now deliveries Off Of comex
00:17:30.590 || 00:17:30.600 || lbma You also mentioned uh the Shanghai
00:17:33.350 || 00:17:33.360 || exchange their deliveries there so
00:17:34.850 || 00:17:34.860 || um I know you've mentioned in the past
00:17:36.890 || 00:17:36.900 || how we're really entering silver squeeze
00:17:39.230 || 00:17:39.240 || number two can you expand on the
00:17:41.690 || 00:17:41.700 || physical demand we're seeing across the
00:17:42.830 || 00:17:42.840 || board and how that's going to be
00:17:45.230 || 00:17:45.240 || impacting the price yeah so fiscal
00:17:46.789 || 00:17:46.799 || demand across the board for silver I'll
00:17:48.710 || 00:17:48.720 || just I'll focus on Silver here because
00:17:50.210 || 00:17:50.220 || gold there's a lot of above ground gold
00:17:53.450 || 00:17:53.460 || right so it really takes a lot to to
00:17:54.950 || 00:17:54.960 || kind of move that market from a physical
00:17:57.289 || 00:17:57.299 || perspective and usually gold it's more
00:18:00.289 || 00:18:00.299 || of a trade around safety it's more of a
00:18:02.870 || 00:18:02.880 || trade around Sovereign central banks
00:18:05.210 || 00:18:05.220 || gobbling it up people get involved I
00:18:06.710 || 00:18:06.720 || mean there is a portion of that market
00:18:11.029 || 00:18:11.039 || that is uh demand for industrial use but
00:18:12.409 || 00:18:12.419 || most of that Market's either going to be
00:18:14.630 || 00:18:14.640 || jewelry which I would argue is a form of
00:18:17.330 || 00:18:17.340 || long-term investment bars and coins and
00:18:19.190 || 00:18:19.200 || just stockpiles of gold really that
00:18:21.650 || 00:18:21.660 || people use for uh assets like central
00:18:23.450 || 00:18:23.460 || banks and Commercial banks for Basel III
00:18:25.190 || 00:18:25.200 || silver is a different animal
00:18:28.430 || 00:18:28.440 || most over ever mined is used in very
00:18:30.470 || 00:18:30.480 || small quantities across a wide variety
00:18:32.029 || 00:18:32.039 || of products that often get buried in
00:18:34.190 || 00:18:34.200 || landfills and so it's still there it
00:18:36.710 || 00:18:36.720 || didn't get destroyed but it's extremely
00:18:38.450 || 00:18:38.460 || costly to try to go buying that stuff
00:18:40.010 || 00:18:40.020 || out of landfills it's more costly it is
00:18:42.409 || 00:18:42.419 || to pull it out of the ground uh pull it
00:18:43.610 || 00:18:43.620 || you know get it from Mother Earth
00:18:47.570 || 00:18:47.580 || essentially so I honestly think
00:18:50.330 || 00:18:50.340 || um silver could be the really the one to
00:18:53.029 || 00:18:53.039 || watch here and again as I said beginning
00:18:55.490 || 00:18:55.500 || the program all year long actually
00:18:57.169 || 00:18:57.179 || dating back to Silver squeeze last year
00:18:58.669 || 00:18:58.679 || last two days January first day of
00:19:01.490 || 00:19:01.500 || February last year we've had big players
00:19:03.289 || 00:19:03.299 || pulling silver out and I think
00:19:05.450 || 00:19:05.460 || originally a lot of it was industrial
00:19:07.549 || 00:19:07.559 || demand because if we think about what
00:19:09.230 || 00:19:09.240 || the silver Institute has been reporting
00:19:11.930 || 00:19:11.940 || we're now 2022 is now year number four
00:19:14.690 || 00:19:14.700 || in shortages and they're predicting in
00:19:18.070 || 00:19:18.080 || 2023 that we have a record shortage of
00:19:21.470 || 00:19:21.480 || 194 million ounces between what the
00:19:24.230 || 00:19:24.240 || miners are producing and what we
00:19:26.750 || 00:19:26.760 || actually use as Society between between
00:19:28.970 || 00:19:28.980 || industrial and investment now think
00:19:31.430 || 00:19:31.440 || about that for a moment 194 million
00:19:33.470 || 00:19:33.480 || ounces you could drain most of the free
00:19:36.169 || 00:19:36.179 || silver on both comex and London
00:19:39.230 || 00:19:39.240 || exchanges just next year with that
00:19:41.990 || 00:19:42.000 || deficit in mine production and if you
00:19:44.210 || 00:19:44.220 || look at what's going on the Shanghai and
00:19:46.310 || 00:19:46.320 || amount of deliveries over there that
00:19:48.890 || 00:19:48.900 || number could actually go higher so you
00:19:51.470 || 00:19:51.480 || could actually be looking at a a market
00:19:55.190 || 00:19:55.200 || in 2023 for silver that does not have
00:19:56.750 || 00:19:56.760 || any
00:20:00.970 || 00:20:00.980 || publicly well-known large silver
00:20:03.770 || 00:20:03.780 || stockpiles that can be used to account
00:20:06.830 || 00:20:06.840 || for shortages and I think at some point
00:20:10.190 || 00:20:10.200 || in 2023 the shortage situation in silver
00:20:11.990 || 00:20:12.000 || is going to come to a head and you're
00:20:13.370 || 00:20:13.380 || going to see officials start talking
00:20:15.529 || 00:20:15.539 || about it I think industry will talk
00:20:17.210 || 00:20:17.220 || about it first and then I think
00:20:18.590 || 00:20:18.600 || officials are going to start talking
00:20:19.669 || 00:20:19.679 || about it
00:20:22.430 || 00:20:22.440 || and if we end up going deeper into a
00:20:23.870 || 00:20:23.880 || worldwide recession let's say Europe
00:20:25.970 || 00:20:25.980 || starts going to a deep recession this
00:20:28.250 || 00:20:28.260 || winter as a result of energy situations
00:20:31.250 || 00:20:31.260 || and basically a debt load then you can
00:20:32.570 || 00:20:32.580 || start to see a situation where people
00:20:34.430 || 00:20:34.440 || flood into silver from an investment
00:20:37.610 || 00:20:37.620 || perspective the key question for 2023
00:20:40.490 || 00:20:40.500 || that I have in silver is if we go into
00:20:43.010 || 00:20:43.020 || recession and there's a reduction in
00:20:45.710 || 00:20:45.720 || silver use for industrial purposes will
00:20:47.450 || 00:20:47.460 || the investors because we're in recession
00:20:50.930 || 00:20:50.940 || demand more silver for investment and if
00:20:52.789 || 00:20:52.799 || they do that's it I think silver
00:20:54.710 || 00:20:54.720 || probably starts to break next year
00:20:57.409 || 00:20:57.419 || because if if silver institute's right
00:20:59.870 || 00:20:59.880 || if their prediction is right and we go
00:21:01.490 || 00:21:01.500 || we need about an extra 200 million
00:21:04.909 || 00:21:04.919 || ounces of what we're producing then that
00:21:07.130 || 00:21:07.140 || is going to Royal the silver market
00:21:08.450 || 00:21:08.460 || because the last two years we've been
00:21:10.669 || 00:21:10.679 || draining our above ground stockpiles and
00:21:13.010 || 00:21:13.020 || again unless silver goes to 50 to 60 70
00:21:14.690 || 00:21:14.700 || bucks an ounce you can't go get it out
00:21:16.310 || 00:21:16.320 || of the landfills it's not cost effective
00:21:18.890 || 00:21:18.900 || so that price all the factors point to
00:21:23.710 || 00:21:23.720 || Silver Rising it has to at some point or
00:21:25.370 || 00:21:25.380 || manufacturers are going to come out and
00:21:27.289 || 00:21:27.299 || say I have no silver and then what's
00:21:28.909 || 00:21:28.919 || going to happen is what happened to lme
00:21:30.169 || 00:21:30.179 || and nickel it's going to go vertical
00:21:32.270 || 00:21:32.280 || they're going to stop trade and
00:21:34.250 || 00:21:34.260 || literally there's not going to be a spot
00:21:36.890 || 00:21:36.900 || price on silver it's essentially going
00:21:39.890 || 00:21:39.900 || to be an unpriced market and that's
00:21:41.270 || 00:21:41.280 || something that has a potential to happen
00:21:45.350 || 00:21:45.360 || 2023 maybe 2024. unless we have a bunch
00:21:46.850 || 00:21:46.860 || of new minds all of a sudden just
00:21:48.289 || 00:21:48.299 || mysteriously come online and start
00:21:49.610 || 00:21:49.620 || cranking out a couple hundred extra
00:21:51.110 || 00:21:51.120 || million ounces of silver
00:21:53.510 || 00:21:53.520 || most silver is not does it not come out
00:21:55.190 || 00:21:55.200 || of primary several mines it comes out as
00:21:58.190 || 00:21:58.200 || a byproduct of copper gold these other
00:22:02.270 || 00:22:02.280 || poly metallic base metal mines
00:22:03.950 || 00:22:03.960 || and so if you look at the supply chain
00:22:06.110 || 00:22:06.120 || and we go into a recession and those
00:22:07.909 || 00:22:07.919 || mines can't operate because they don't
00:22:10.070 || 00:22:10.080 || have income and you start shutting down
00:22:12.470 || 00:22:12.480 || copper mines and gold mines and lead
00:22:13.430 || 00:22:13.440 || mines
00:22:17.090 || 00:22:17.100 || 72 percent of silver comes out of as a
00:22:18.770 || 00:22:18.780 || secondary metal out of those other mines
00:22:21.230 || 00:22:21.240 || and so if any of those mines start to
00:22:22.909 || 00:22:22.919 || retract their silver production then it
00:22:25.610 || 00:22:25.620 || gets massively worse Elijah and it can
00:22:27.770 || 00:22:27.780 || take anywhere from two to seven to ten
00:22:30.649 || 00:22:30.659 || years to ramp up new primary Silver
00:22:32.390 || 00:22:32.400 || Mines and there aren't that many great
00:22:34.190 || 00:22:34.200 || silver deposits in the world a lot of
00:22:36.169 || 00:22:36.179 || them are Mexico and Peru you got some
00:22:37.549 || 00:22:37.559 || sprinkle here there
00:22:38.870 || 00:22:38.880 || but it's not like there are a whole
00:22:41.270 || 00:22:41.280 || bunch of them so I think really
00:22:43.010 || 00:22:43.020 || I know this is a really long answer but
00:22:45.230 || 00:22:45.240 || really 2023 could be the year for silver
00:22:46.909 || 00:22:46.919 || that's a big one and we're just gonna
00:22:48.770 || 00:22:48.780 || have to watch it there is really a
00:22:51.350 || 00:22:51.360 || brewing situation with supplies and it's
00:22:53.630 || 00:22:53.640 || starting to get pretty darn serious
00:22:55.549 || 00:22:55.559 || now if you could maybe help our viewers
00:22:56.810 || 00:22:56.820 || kind of put this in perspective because
00:22:59.630 || 00:22:59.640 || we do have a question from Sarge about
00:23:01.970 || 00:23:01.980 || what the number of available ounces of
00:23:03.950 || 00:23:03.960 || gold and silver are above ground you're
00:23:06.289 || 00:23:06.299 || talking about how there's a supply
00:23:08.149 || 00:23:08.159 || deficit that the silver Institute is
00:23:09.710 || 00:23:09.720 || reporting on
00:23:13.070 || 00:23:13.080 || um that matters obviously if there's not
00:23:15.830 || 00:23:15.840 || a lot of just excess Supply and you
00:23:17.690 || 00:23:17.700 || mentioned that that Supply deficit could
00:23:20.330 || 00:23:20.340 || drain the comex could drain the lbma
00:23:22.010 || 00:23:22.020 || um you know Alone
00:23:25.010 || 00:23:25.020 || um but what is your knowledge about the
00:23:27.289 || 00:23:27.299 || above ground silver supplies and also we
00:23:29.450 || 00:23:29.460 || can touch on gold but silver first
00:23:31.370 || 00:23:31.380 || yeah this is a difficult one because
00:23:32.690 || 00:23:32.700 || some of the people have been in this
00:23:36.049 || 00:23:36.059 || industry for the longest are uh you know
00:23:38.870 || 00:23:38.880 || Alistair McLeod people who are really
00:23:41.149 || 00:23:41.159 || focused on this Ed steer running Manny
00:23:42.049 || 00:23:42.059 || guys have been following us for a long
00:23:44.570 || 00:23:44.580 || time I've interviewed uh most or all of
00:23:46.909 || 00:23:46.919 || them recently talked to a lot of them
00:23:50.390 || 00:23:50.400 || and you know it's a really opaque market
00:23:53.930 || 00:23:53.940 || so if you look at how comex operates if
00:23:55.789 || 00:23:55.799 || you believe all the inventory data on
00:23:58.610 || 00:23:58.620 || comex you have a fairly good idea in the
00:24:01.130 || 00:24:01.140 || registered category of what's Liquid the
00:24:03.289 || 00:24:03.299 || big Bugaboo on comex for both gold and
00:24:05.390 || 00:24:05.400 || silver is the eligible category uh the
00:24:07.730 || 00:24:07.740 || semi-group came out emitted along the
00:24:11.450 || 00:24:11.460 || cftc or to the cftc in in a memo last
00:24:12.470 || 00:24:12.480 || year I believe
00:24:14.810 || 00:24:14.820 || that if you looked at all the eligible
00:24:18.890 || 00:24:18.900 || stocks of gold and silver on Comics they
00:24:22.130 || 00:24:22.140 || don't know if half of it is free or it
00:24:24.049 || 00:24:24.059 || because it's private owned they don't
00:24:25.970 || 00:24:25.980 || know what that Silver's been accounted
00:24:30.950 || 00:24:30.960 || for the exchange does does not
00:24:33.529 || 00:24:33.539 || um the the eligible gold and silver does
00:24:35.330 || 00:24:35.340 || not get reported to The Exchange in
00:24:36.830 || 00:24:36.840 || terms of what's free and what's not
00:24:39.169 || 00:24:39.179 || because those are private contracts the
00:24:40.850 || 00:24:40.860 || only way that you could get more gold
00:24:42.529 || 00:24:42.539 || and silver out of eligible is one of
00:24:44.570 || 00:24:44.580 || those private holders then said okay
00:24:46.430 || 00:24:46.440 || I'll give it up at the current price and
00:24:47.630 || 00:24:47.640 || on Silver they're not going to do it at
00:24:48.649 || 00:24:48.659 || twenty three dollars I can pretty much
00:24:50.690 || 00:24:50.700 || guarantee you but we don't know how much
00:24:52.190 || 00:24:52.200 || of that's liquid that's the problem
00:24:54.230 || 00:24:54.240 || because a lot of what goes on the gold
00:24:57.230 || 00:24:57.240 || and silver market it's private contracts
00:24:59.450 || 00:24:59.460 || um if you look at London there's
00:25:02.210 || 00:25:02.220 || something like 830 million ounces of
00:25:03.590 || 00:25:03.600 || silver left in London if you go the lb
00:25:06.649 || 00:25:06.659 || May's website the majority of that is an
00:25:09.409 || 00:25:09.419 || ETF so if I look at ETFs right now there
00:25:16.549 || 00:25:16.559 || like hundreds of millions of ounces
00:25:19.789 || 00:25:19.799 || pledged to ETFs the SLB
00:25:24.110 || 00:25:24.120 || um the uh Deutsche Bank bullion Vault a
00:25:26.210 || 00:25:26.220 || lot of these these ETFs store in London
00:25:28.669 || 00:25:28.679 || not all and a lot of that silver is
00:25:30.289 || 00:25:30.299 || accounted for and if you look at the
00:25:32.029 || 00:25:32.039 || silver it's been run off of the London
00:25:34.070 || 00:25:34.080 || Market you're talking over 100 million
00:25:36.049 || 00:25:36.059 || ounces in a very short period of time
00:25:38.510 || 00:25:38.520 || and if you're dating back to to last
00:25:40.130 || 00:25:40.140 || year with silver squeeze because silver
00:25:43.430 || 00:25:43.440 || squeeze was pulling so or was investing
00:25:45.409 || 00:25:45.419 || in SLV SLV stores through silver and
00:25:46.490 || 00:25:46.500 || London so what happens a lot of that
00:25:48.590 || 00:25:48.600 || free silver in London got put over into
00:25:51.350 || 00:25:51.360 || SLV and not all of it's come back out to
00:25:52.669 || 00:25:52.679 || be free silver
00:25:54.649 || 00:25:54.659 || then of course you got Shanghai and they
00:25:56.330 || 00:25:56.340 || don't report what's free and not it's
00:25:58.130 || 00:25:58.140 || not even on their report they just tell
00:26:00.110 || 00:26:00.120 || you what the deliveries are what the
00:26:01.730 || 00:26:01.740 || contracts look like what the prices are
00:26:03.769 || 00:26:03.779 || but you don't even get a view into that
00:26:05.510 || 00:26:05.520 || one and then we're even talking about
00:26:07.250 || 00:26:07.260 || private stockpiles around the world
00:26:08.690 || 00:26:08.700 || they're religious organizations
00:26:11.870 || 00:26:11.880 || companies manufacturers there are some
00:26:13.970 || 00:26:13.980 || minors that are holding some back so
00:26:16.430 || 00:26:16.440 || honestly there is no way to know
00:26:18.110 || 00:26:18.120 || um unless you had a reporting
00:26:20.210 || 00:26:20.220 || requirement for every minor and every
00:26:22.909 || 00:26:22.919 || depository and every uh private citizen
00:26:24.710 || 00:26:24.720 || family office to report the Holdings we
00:26:26.510 || 00:26:26.520 || really don't know what's available all
00:26:28.190 || 00:26:28.200 || that we can do is kind of look at the
00:26:30.590 || 00:26:30.600 || big numbers on the big exchanges and do
00:26:32.630 || 00:26:32.640 || the best that we can with those and make
00:26:34.909 || 00:26:34.919 || some assumptions and it's very clear
00:26:37.070 || 00:26:37.080 || that of the transparent reportable free
00:26:40.010 || 00:26:40.020 || silver it has just been whacked and
00:26:41.570 || 00:26:41.580 || there's not a whole lot left I don't
00:26:43.730 || 00:26:43.740 || have a number for you on what it is but
00:26:45.830 || 00:26:45.840 || it's let's put it this way it's a heck
00:26:47.510 || 00:26:47.520 || of a lot less than we've had over the
00:26:48.830 || 00:26:48.840 || last four to five years that's for sure
00:26:51.649 || 00:26:51.659 || and if we keep going down the path we're
00:26:53.029 || 00:26:53.039 || going gonna run out
00:26:55.250 || 00:26:55.260 || and the only thing that would save us is
00:26:57.769 || 00:26:57.779 || if a lot of that sitting
00:27:00.830 || 00:27:00.840 || you know in London and in Comax if
00:27:02.750 || 00:27:02.760 || people say okay I'm going to let that
00:27:05.990 || 00:27:06.000 || silver go but the key there excuse me
00:27:08.810 || 00:27:08.820 || the key there is is that silver really
00:27:10.490 || 00:27:10.500 || free
00:27:12.409 || 00:27:12.419 || um that silver could be pledged for some
00:27:13.789 || 00:27:13.799 || other purpose it could be pledged to a
00:27:15.350 || 00:27:15.360 || company to use it it could be pledged to
00:27:17.029 || 00:27:17.039 || an investor who's just storing it over
00:27:19.549 || 00:27:19.559 || there we don't know so nobody really
00:27:22.310 || 00:27:22.320 || knows but we do know the freely reported
00:27:24.169 || 00:27:24.179 || silver has come way way down gold
00:27:25.909 || 00:27:25.919 || there's a lot more available that's why
00:27:28.549 || 00:27:28.559 || I'm more bullish on Silver for 2023 the
00:27:30.649 || 00:27:30.659 || thing that will pop goal for 2023 is
00:27:32.510 || 00:27:32.520 || going to be the central banks if we have
00:27:34.909 || 00:27:34.919 || a deeper session and the Central Bank
00:27:36.529 || 00:27:36.539 || start gobbling up gold again they're the
00:27:38.210 || 00:27:38.220 || biggest buyers that'll pop gold really
00:27:41.390 || 00:27:41.400 || quick if we see any of the of the
00:27:43.370 || 00:27:43.380 || sovereigns come out and report that
00:27:44.810 || 00:27:44.820 || they're interested in gold or if we see
00:27:46.549 || 00:27:46.559 || a big investor say their interest in
00:27:48.409 || 00:27:48.419 || Gold that will pop gold but I think
00:27:50.750 || 00:27:50.760 || silver will be the bigger move in 2023.
00:27:53.149 || 00:27:53.159 || I'm I'm Uber bullish on Silver because
00:27:55.370 || 00:27:55.380 || of the actual Supply demand fundamentals
00:27:57.830 || 00:27:57.840 || we do have a question from Jack uh on
00:28:00.049 || 00:28:00.059 || central banks I know that essential
00:28:01.850 || 00:28:01.860 || banks have buying a whole been buying a
00:28:03.890 || 00:28:03.900 || whole lot of gold recently I think it's
00:28:06.590 || 00:28:06.600 || the most in more than half a decade
00:28:08.390 || 00:28:08.400 || um or more than half a century I should
00:28:09.470 || 00:28:09.480 || say actually
00:28:11.930 || 00:28:11.940 || um and but it seems like well why are
00:28:14.029 || 00:28:14.039 || why are they not stacking silver and his
00:28:15.710 || 00:28:15.720 || question is are they stacking silver and
00:28:17.090 || 00:28:17.100 || if so why not
00:28:19.070 || 00:28:19.080 || somebody could be stacking silver I mean
00:28:20.330 || 00:28:20.340 || if you look at like the Central Bank
00:28:22.210 || 00:28:22.220 || Commercial Bank they don't view silver
00:28:24.769 || 00:28:24.779 || as a high quality liquid asset they view
00:28:26.330 || 00:28:26.340 || gold as a high quality liquid asset I
00:28:28.669 || 00:28:28.679 || think the market including the exchanges
00:28:30.649 || 00:28:30.659 || the cfdc Commissioners all those guys
00:28:34.190 || 00:28:34.200 || see silver as an industrial product and
00:28:36.169 || 00:28:36.179 || I think that's why there's this blind
00:28:39.409 || 00:28:39.419 || spot Elijah to how big the silver move
00:28:41.149 || 00:28:41.159 || could be because if you're just looking
00:28:42.769 || 00:28:42.779 || at it from an industrial perspective and
00:28:44.390 || 00:28:44.400 || you're not looking at the potential for
00:28:46.909 || 00:28:46.919 || investment for somebody to come in there
00:28:48.730 || 00:28:48.740 || and really gobble up a bunch of silver
00:28:51.289 || 00:28:51.299 || uh you know things get get interesting
00:28:52.909 || 00:28:52.919 || really easily now I have somebody up
00:28:54.769 || 00:28:54.779 || until this point stockpiled tons of
00:28:56.690 || 00:28:56.700 || silver I mean the rumors that JP Morgan
00:28:58.630 || 00:28:58.640 || has some and some other people have it
00:29:02.149 || 00:29:02.159 || uh but it's not going to be enough to
00:29:03.529 || 00:29:03.539 || satisfy demand over the next couple
00:29:05.510 || 00:29:05.520 || years I mean we're using 1.2 billion
00:29:07.310 || 00:29:07.320 || ounces we think next year according
00:29:10.669 || 00:29:10.679 || silver Institute that's a 16 increase I
00:29:13.010 || 00:29:13.020 || I don't see a 16 increase in eligible
00:29:15.590 || 00:29:15.600 || inventories on comex I don't see a 16
00:29:17.029 || 00:29:17.039 || increase
00:29:20.570 || 00:29:20.580 || in lbma and that's actually Fallen by a
00:29:22.970 || 00:29:22.980 || lot more than that so yeah I think the
00:29:24.230 || 00:29:24.240 || fundamentals are saying that gold and
00:29:25.789 || 00:29:25.799 || silver are going to go up
00:29:29.630 || 00:29:29.640 || and I think that at this point it's just
00:29:31.430 || 00:29:31.440 || a waiting game we're just waiting for
00:29:32.930 || 00:29:32.940 || something to break in that market and
00:29:35.210 || 00:29:35.220 || really tell us where we are
00:29:37.010 || 00:29:37.020 || well Robert Keynes we really appreciate
00:29:38.810 || 00:29:38.820 || your time today and definitely answering
00:29:40.070 || 00:29:40.080 || our viewers questions we'll have to have
00:29:42.049 || 00:29:42.059 || you back on for another one of these
00:29:44.750 || 00:29:44.760 || live q a sessions but it's been great to
00:29:46.490 || 00:29:46.500 || have you uh your YouTube channel is gold
00:29:48.830 || 00:29:48.840 || silver Pros goldsilverpros.com as well
00:29:50.750 || 00:29:50.760 || any last thoughts before we let you go
00:29:52.610 || 00:29:52.620 || and yeah I mean it's just been a crazy
00:29:54.409 || 00:29:54.419 || week in metals so we really appreciate
00:29:56.169 || 00:29:56.179 || uh the update here
00:29:58.610 || 00:29:58.620 || simple I say just buy gold and silver
00:30:00.169 || 00:30:00.179 || don't worry about the price dollar cost
00:30:02.210 || 00:30:02.220 || average in buy when you can because the
00:30:03.409 || 00:30:03.419 || end of the day the prices don't matter
00:30:05.149 || 00:30:05.159 || when there's a shortage because it's
00:30:08.029 || 00:30:08.039 || entertainment much as Mike Maloney says
00:30:10.190 || 00:30:10.200 || silver at some point in the next year or
00:30:12.529 || 00:30:12.539 || two is going to be unobtainium at any
00:30:14.450 || 00:30:14.460 || price because people aren't going to let
00:30:15.769 || 00:30:15.779 || it go because when you have a deep
00:30:18.649 || 00:30:18.659 || scarcity people hold and especially when
00:30:20.149 || 00:30:20.159 || we have recessionary forces in the
00:30:23.269 || 00:30:23.279 || economy so gold and silver to me are the
00:30:25.430 || 00:30:25.440 || are the place to be 2022 Illustrated
00:30:28.070 || 00:30:28.080 || what was the best investment gold silver
