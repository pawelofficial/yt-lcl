00:00:00.169 || 00:00:00.179 || [Music]
00:00:01.670 || 00:00:01.680 || the other point what you're looking at
00:00:04.610 || 00:00:04.620 || is when money comes out of equity
00:00:07.249 || 00:00:07.259 || markets which it will okay it goes it's
00:00:09.770 || 00:00:09.780 || going to go somewhere and typically one
00:00:11.750 || 00:00:11.760 || of the best places for money to go is
00:00:14.150 || 00:00:14.160 || Commodities and then of course we get
00:00:15.530 || 00:00:15.540 || into the gold and silver part of the
00:00:16.970 || 00:00:16.980 || Commodities which are hard asset
00:00:19.130 || 00:00:19.140 || Commodities those are like going at home
00:00:21.470 || 00:00:21.480 || those are some security for those who
00:00:23.870 || 00:00:23.880 || are concerned and at some point Elijah
00:00:26.330 || 00:00:26.340 || we may have to use gold and silver as a
00:00:28.790 || 00:00:28.800 || currency again

00:01:42.890 || 00:01:42.900 || us today is our good friend Todd Bubba
00:01:44.569 || 00:01:44.579 || Horwitz Todd thank you so much for
00:01:46.550 || 00:01:46.560 || joining us today Elijah great to be with
00:01:48.590 || 00:01:48.600 || you and uh happy holidays and happy New
00:01:50.090 || 00:01:50.100 || Year and I'm looking forward to the New
00:01:51.350 || 00:01:51.360 || Year's at the start
00:01:53.450 || 00:01:53.460 || definitely same to you and I would like
00:01:55.670 || 00:01:55.680 || to kind of get a year-end review on the
00:01:57.950 || 00:01:57.960 || markets um if we want to start with the
00:01:59.270 || 00:01:59.280 || stock market because I think that was
00:02:01.370 || 00:02:01.380 || probably the most surprising for a lot
00:02:03.830 || 00:02:03.840 || of people we had been in a raging bull
00:02:06.590 || 00:02:06.600 || market for years and now we are down on
00:02:08.630 || 00:02:08.640 || the year quite a bit depending on the
00:02:10.550 || 00:02:10.560 || indices that you're looking at well you
00:02:12.110 || 00:02:12.120 || know again I thought the markets were
00:02:14.210 || 00:02:14.220 || performed pretty well based on where
00:02:15.949 || 00:02:15.959 || they should be I mean if you look at the
00:02:18.229 || 00:02:18.239 || overall economy we we've got some pretty
00:02:20.630 || 00:02:20.640 || big issues in this country including
00:02:23.809 || 00:02:23.819 || every ridiculous CPI number right I mean
00:02:26.630 || 00:02:26.640 || inflation is much higher than 7.1
00:02:29.510 || 00:02:29.520 || percent which was the last report on CPI
00:02:31.369 || 00:02:31.379 || I thought that you know after last
00:02:33.050 || 00:02:33.060 || year's first quarter and we're down
00:02:34.850 || 00:02:34.860 || almost 20 percent across the board that
00:02:37.670 || 00:02:37.680 || we would hit my target which is 50 to 70
00:02:39.589 || 00:02:39.599 || before this is all said and done which
00:02:41.750 || 00:02:41.760 || means that I still believe that that's
00:02:43.250 || 00:02:43.260 || coming and I think that going forward
00:02:45.770 || 00:02:45.780 || it'll get ugly but last year was really
00:02:48.050 || 00:02:48.060 || quiet the markets were really in
00:02:50.330 || 00:02:50.340 || consolidation uh you know getting ready
00:02:52.369 || 00:02:52.379 || to make the next big move into a trend I
00:02:53.809 || 00:02:53.819 || mean if you go back and look at a weekly
00:02:56.089 || 00:02:56.099 || chart over the last 15 months you're
00:02:57.290 || 00:02:57.300 || going to see that we haven't gone very
00:03:00.110 || 00:03:00.120 || far and you know bull markets eventually
00:03:02.809 || 00:03:02.819 || end uh now we all know that that over
00:03:04.850 || 00:03:04.860 || time the markets go up eight and a half
00:03:07.070 || 00:03:07.080 || percent year over year however we have
00:03:08.930 || 00:03:08.940 || had a pretty Raging Bull market and
00:03:11.630 || 00:03:11.640 || under under what circumstances is the
00:03:13.430 || 00:03:13.440 || bull market is it the money supply that
00:03:15.350 || 00:03:15.360 || continued to get added which really
00:03:17.330 || 00:03:17.340 || makes your dollars worth less you know I
00:03:19.309 || 00:03:19.319 || always have the one comparison that I
00:03:20.390 || 00:03:20.400 || can use
00:03:22.850 || 00:03:22.860 || when I started trading in 1980 the Dow
00:03:26.149 || 00:03:26.159 || was at 800. okay so now that that was at
00:03:29.089 || 00:03:29.099 || 35 000 whatever the number it is so I
00:03:31.130 || 00:03:31.140 || thought the year was you know did better
00:03:33.589 || 00:03:33.599 || than I thought it would based on every
00:03:36.290 || 00:03:36.300 || factor that is out there and and and how
00:03:38.089 || 00:03:38.099 || our company is going to make money the
00:03:39.890 || 00:03:39.900 || jobs are horrible no matter how they're
00:03:42.229 || 00:03:42.239 || reported because once again and this is
00:03:44.809 || 00:03:44.819 || not a a Democrat a republican issue that
00:03:47.030 || 00:03:47.040 || or a Biden issue it's the way we report
00:03:49.850 || 00:03:49.860 || jobs numbers they use the wrong formula
00:03:52.250 || 00:03:52.260 || they use u3 versus the U6 it doesn't
00:03:54.110 || 00:03:54.120 || show that we've lost two million jobs
00:03:58.070 || 00:03:58.080 || since May so to me it's a mess and it
00:04:00.410 || 00:04:00.420 || and the markets outperformed what I
00:04:02.030 || 00:04:02.040 || thought they would do once they get
00:04:02.990 || 00:04:03.000 || started
00:04:05.210 || 00:04:05.220 || now is that just because of the you know
00:04:06.830 || 00:04:06.840 || the government fudging numbers to make
00:04:09.530 || 00:04:09.540 || things look good what are the reasons
00:04:11.270 || 00:04:11.280 || that the markets did better than
00:04:13.789 || 00:04:13.799 || expected well I think it's artificial
00:04:15.530 || 00:04:15.540 || numbers I think it's the addition of the
00:04:17.330 || 00:04:17.340 || my Supply but I think it's really more
00:04:20.509 || 00:04:20.519 || the hidden tax right I mean you know we
00:04:23.749 || 00:04:23.759 || went to war you know in 1776 taxation
00:04:26.150 || 00:04:26.160 || without representation and I think that
00:04:28.490 || 00:04:28.500 || the markets were able to continue to go
00:04:30.050 || 00:04:30.060 || a little bit higher or stay steady
00:04:32.090 || 00:04:32.100 || because of the overwhelming money supply
00:04:34.790 || 00:04:34.800 || and the cheap money now money is not so
00:04:36.050 || 00:04:36.060 || cheap anymore let's see what happens
00:04:37.969 || 00:04:37.979 || going into the new year
00:04:39.770 || 00:04:39.780 || and what are you expecting for the
00:04:41.570 || 00:04:41.580 || markets this year because I know we've
00:04:43.189 || 00:04:43.199 || had you on quite a bit before and you
00:04:45.469 || 00:04:45.479 || had been predicting uh that this bear
00:04:49.249 || 00:04:49.259 || Market will lead to a you know horrific
00:04:51.350 || 00:04:51.360 || crash that in the stock market will be
00:04:53.629 || 00:04:53.639 || down at least about 60 I believe you
00:04:55.969 || 00:04:55.979 || said so is that your anticipation for
00:04:57.830 || 00:04:57.840 || next year I think before it's all done
00:04:59.930 || 00:04:59.940 || Elijah I think that we'll get down to
00:05:03.950 || 00:05:03.960 || that 60 60 to 70 percent uh you know
00:05:05.810 || 00:05:05.820 || we'll add in what we did this year let's
00:05:07.909 || 00:05:07.919 || say 20. uh and I think there's a lot
00:05:09.770 || 00:05:09.780 || more to go I mean I would look for the s
00:05:14.270 || 00:05:14.280 || p you want a number uh 1562 is the
00:05:16.070 || 00:05:16.080 || number I'm looking at in the s p at the
00:05:19.129 || 00:05:19.139 || moment is is somewhere around you know
00:05:22.610 || 00:05:22.620 || 40 uh 3 800. okay so that's what I'm
00:05:25.010 || 00:05:25.020 || looking for uh that takes us back into
00:05:27.290 || 00:05:27.300 || dial you know fifteen sixteen thousand
00:05:29.150 || 00:05:29.160 || and those are the numbers I'm looking
00:05:31.189 || 00:05:31.199 || for I don't see anything that that can
00:05:32.270 || 00:05:32.280 || prevent
00:05:35.810 || 00:05:35.820 || a major meltdown barring we don't change
00:05:38.150 || 00:05:38.160 || our energy policy we don't stop our
00:05:39.529 || 00:05:39.539 || government spending I mean if you look
00:05:40.909 || 00:05:40.919 || at the item that the spending bullet
00:05:42.770 || 00:05:42.780 || just came out at 1.8 trillion dollars I
00:05:44.450 || 00:05:44.460 || mean it's it's it's almost laughable
00:05:46.189 || 00:05:46.199 || like there's a never-ending supply of
00:05:48.529 || 00:05:48.539 || money as they continue to destroy the
00:05:49.969 || 00:05:49.979 || middle class and small business and
00:05:52.129 || 00:05:52.139 || remember one thing without a middle
00:05:55.490 || 00:05:55.500 || class no Society thrive
00:05:57.650 || 00:05:57.660 || okay the board keeps mooching off the
00:05:59.390 || 00:05:59.400 || government and the rich gets to get
00:06:01.129 || 00:06:01.139 || richer and the and the middle classes
00:06:04.310 || 00:06:04.320 || get destroyed no when it comes to this
00:06:05.629 || 00:06:05.639 || crash I mean a lot of people are
00:06:07.610 || 00:06:07.620 || invested if they go by you know
00:06:09.529 || 00:06:09.539 || traditional financial planning right of
00:06:12.830 || 00:06:12.840 || the 60 stocks 40 bonds
00:06:14.689 || 00:06:14.699 || um how are they going to be impacted
00:06:17.689 || 00:06:17.699 || financially in this crash well I think
00:06:19.909 || 00:06:19.919 || that that'll depend on the individual
00:06:21.830 || 00:06:21.840 || you know this is this is always a very
00:06:24.710 || 00:06:24.720 || tricky topic to talk about you know if
00:06:27.350 || 00:06:27.360 || you if you believe in America and I hope
00:06:29.270 || 00:06:29.280 || you do then you're gonna hit you're
00:06:30.890 || 00:06:30.900 || gonna know that no matter what happens
00:06:33.770 || 00:06:33.780 || you know no matter how bad this
00:06:35.689 || 00:06:35.699 || Administration screws things up we're
00:06:36.950 || 00:06:36.960 || going to have an election in two years
00:06:39.590 || 00:06:39.600 || again and have a chance to correct it uh
00:06:41.270 || 00:06:41.280 || the econ we should continue to grow
00:06:43.129 || 00:06:43.139 || unless there's too much destruction done
00:06:45.230 || 00:06:45.240 || now if you're over leveraged or over
00:06:47.749 || 00:06:47.759 || invested and you're going to get nervous
00:06:50.150 || 00:06:50.160 || with every downtick then you're probably
00:06:51.590 || 00:06:51.600 || better off being in CDs right now
00:06:53.090 || 00:06:53.100 || because of the inverted yield curve I
00:06:54.409 || 00:06:54.419 || mean you can get three month money right
00:06:56.629 || 00:06:56.639 || now for about four and a half percent so
00:06:59.150 || 00:06:59.160 || but if you're if you're a Believer and
00:07:00.650 || 00:07:00.660 || you and you believe in this true
00:07:02.450 || 00:07:02.460 || statistics of the market which is eight
00:07:03.830 || 00:07:03.840 || and a half percent games year over year
00:07:06.469 || 00:07:06.479 || and you just take the rule of 72 you
00:07:08.390 || 00:07:08.400 || know it doubles and not under nine years
00:07:10.129 || 00:07:10.139 || that's what you have to look at and
00:07:12.170 || 00:07:12.180 || that's when you invest it has to be
00:07:14.210 || 00:07:14.220 || money that is not going to be needed to
00:07:16.909 || 00:07:16.919 || pay the mortgage the car payment or for
00:07:19.550 || 00:07:19.560 || an emergency so still for the long term
00:07:21.770 || 00:07:21.780 || you're saying that stocks are a good
00:07:25.010 || 00:07:25.020 || idea at the moment well listen I'm a
00:07:26.689 || 00:07:26.699 || hundred percent invested in my
00:07:30.170 || 00:07:30.180 || retirement accounts I hedge okay and I
00:07:32.089 || 00:07:32.099 || use derivatives to hedge my portfolio
00:07:35.629 || 00:07:35.639 || and I continue to buy however I can
00:07:37.850 || 00:07:37.860 || afford it and it's I'm not going to lose
00:07:39.770 || 00:07:39.780 || any sleep if the market goes down 60
00:07:42.290 || 00:07:42.300 || next year in fact I'll probably have a
00:07:45.350 || 00:07:45.360 || party because my head will bought me a
00:07:47.270 || 00:07:47.280 || lot more shares and it'll just make my
00:07:50.029 || 00:07:50.039 || position bigger over time but again you
00:07:52.969 || 00:07:52.979 || have to have that type of attitude that
00:07:55.790 || 00:07:55.800 || you cannot worry about you know what
00:07:57.589 || 00:07:57.599 || happens today or tomorrow because the
00:07:59.870 || 00:07:59.880 || market is a marathon not a Sprint
00:08:02.029 || 00:08:02.039 || now when it comes to what the FED is
00:08:04.309 || 00:08:04.319 || doing they've reduced the rate at which
00:08:05.930 || 00:08:05.940 || they're increasing and it you know it's
00:08:07.490 || 00:08:07.500 || expected that they're going to continue
00:08:09.050 || 00:08:09.060 || to reduce that
00:08:10.490 || 00:08:10.500 || um what do you see them doing in the
00:08:13.189 || 00:08:13.199 || next year and it seems like with them
00:08:14.749 || 00:08:14.759 || raising interest rates it has had a
00:08:17.150 || 00:08:17.160 || negative effect on the market so how is
00:08:18.770 || 00:08:18.780 || the fed's policy going to impact the
00:08:20.809 || 00:08:20.819 || markets this coming year well first of
00:08:21.890 || 00:08:21.900 || all I don't believe that the FED is
00:08:23.570 || 00:08:23.580 || going to stop raising rates I think that
00:08:24.950 || 00:08:24.960 || the 10-year notes are going to get up to
00:08:26.809 || 00:08:26.819 || six percent okay right now we're close
00:08:29.629 || 00:08:29.639 || to four okay just under we were over for
00:08:31.249 || 00:08:31.259 || a while the vet is not going to stop
00:08:33.469 || 00:08:33.479 || raising no no Federal Reserve in history
00:08:35.870 || 00:08:35.880 || has ever hiked rates into a recession of
00:08:38.510 || 00:08:38.520 || course when you change the rules of what
00:08:40.490 || 00:08:40.500 || recession is well maybe we're not in a
00:08:42.110 || 00:08:42.120 || recession but I think that everybody
00:08:45.050 || 00:08:45.060 || needs to recognize in their own bank
00:08:47.329 || 00:08:47.339 || balance right if you're spending more
00:08:49.130 || 00:08:49.140 || money are we in a recession or not it's
00:08:50.750 || 00:08:50.760 || not something for an economist to Define
00:08:53.509 || 00:08:53.519 || to tell you what you are you know how
00:08:55.730 || 00:08:55.740 || your personal wealth is doing and the
00:08:57.170 || 00:08:57.180 || FED is going to continue to push these
00:08:59.570 || 00:08:59.580 || rates higher because a they're trying to
00:09:01.430 || 00:09:01.440 || get to to you know digital currencies
00:09:02.990 || 00:09:03.000 || they're trying to create some of this
00:09:05.930 || 00:09:05.940 || havoc in in the guise of we're trying to
00:09:08.509 || 00:09:08.519 || slow down the pace of inflation you
00:09:10.790 || 00:09:10.800 || cannot slow down inflation by printing
00:09:12.530 || 00:09:12.540 || more new money that doesn't work that
00:09:14.449 || 00:09:14.459 || way you cannot borrow your way out of
00:09:17.630 || 00:09:17.640 || debt it seems like inflation is the only
00:09:20.570 || 00:09:20.580 || path forward your perspective on that
00:09:22.610 || 00:09:22.620 || well I mean the inflation that we see
00:09:25.430 || 00:09:25.440 || today is garbage inflation the advice we
00:09:27.170 || 00:09:27.180 || say the information we see today is
00:09:29.870 || 00:09:29.880 || man-made it's not made by demand for
00:09:32.050 || 00:09:32.060 || product it's made because the government
00:09:34.190 || 00:09:34.200 || overspends right we don't have a debt
00:09:36.350 || 00:09:36.360 || problem we have a spending problem and
00:09:38.810 || 00:09:38.820 || of course you saw the Omnibus Bill for
00:09:40.490 || 00:09:40.500 || 1.8 trillion I mean isn't that stupid
00:09:42.290 || 00:09:42.300 || right so we're gonna give more money to
00:09:43.310 || 00:09:43.320 || your brain we're gonna get more money
00:09:44.930 || 00:09:44.940 || all over the world instead of taking
00:09:46.970 || 00:09:46.980 || care of the problems in this country and
00:09:49.070 || 00:09:49.080 || rebuilding the United States of America
00:09:51.050 || 00:09:51.060 || you know they want to go to this green
00:09:53.090 || 00:09:53.100 || energy deal which is a bunch of garbage
00:09:54.949 || 00:09:54.959 || okay look I if you're a believer in
00:09:56.870 || 00:09:56.880 || climate change okay I'm not but if you
00:09:57.530 || 00:09:57.540 || are
00:09:59.810 || 00:09:59.820 || give me a plan and tell me how you're
00:10:01.370 || 00:10:01.380 || going to get there instead of just
00:10:03.829 || 00:10:03.839 || taking my money with no way of of
00:10:06.949 || 00:10:06.959 || getting there you know this goes back to
00:10:08.930 || 00:10:08.940 || my first election I ever voted in every
00:10:11.090 || 00:10:11.100 || president since his promise to fix the
00:10:13.190 || 00:10:13.200 || infrastructure the infrastructure is
00:10:15.350 || 00:10:15.360 || cannot handle what they're trying to
00:10:16.790 || 00:10:16.800 || tell us that they're going to do anyways
00:10:18.889 || 00:10:18.899 || in the meantime they can continue to tax
00:10:21.290 || 00:10:21.300 || us more money and take more out of our
00:10:23.509 || 00:10:23.519 || spending money and out of our pocket for
00:10:26.570 || 00:10:26.580 || garbage and this is the real problem and
00:10:29.389 || 00:10:29.399 || if you want a better example you buy an
00:10:30.710 || 00:10:30.720 || electric car in California they only
00:10:32.210 || 00:10:32.220 || want you to charge it at night because
00:10:34.190 || 00:10:34.200 || empowerment can't handle it and if you
00:10:36.110 || 00:10:36.120 || saw last week the football game in
00:10:38.150 || 00:10:38.160 || Tennessee their power grid couldn't
00:10:39.590 || 00:10:39.600 || handle they couldn't start the game on
00:10:40.850 || 00:10:40.860 || time because the Power Group couldn't
00:10:42.170 || 00:10:42.180 || handle what was going on with the with
00:10:44.930 || 00:10:44.940 || the cold weather so you cannot continue
00:10:47.210 || 00:10:47.220 || to spend and that's why what we're
00:10:48.829 || 00:10:48.839 || really seeing here I think is a mirage
00:10:51.110 || 00:10:51.120 || and that Mirage we know when it happens
00:10:53.150 || 00:10:53.160 || mirage's head when they end and they
00:10:55.069 || 00:10:55.079 || don't end they've never ended well in my
00:10:57.410 || 00:10:57.420 || lifetime when it comes to kind of being
00:10:59.449 || 00:10:59.459 || defensive uh when it comes to inflation
00:11:02.329 || 00:11:02.339 || you've said that 2023 is going to be
00:11:04.670 || 00:11:04.680 || just booming for Commodities and
00:11:06.889 || 00:11:06.899 || precious metals so can you expand on
00:11:08.990 || 00:11:09.000 || kind of why you're reasoning behind that
00:11:11.750 || 00:11:11.760 || and why you see it so 2023 as so
00:11:14.810 || 00:11:14.820 || positive for the quantity sectors well I
00:11:18.350 || 00:11:18.360 || I think that through 2022 we we ignored
00:11:21.530 || 00:11:21.540 || and avoided many of the problems that
00:11:23.630 || 00:11:23.640 || were here okay we have a we have a few a
00:11:25.310 || 00:11:25.320 || food shortage believe it or not there's
00:11:27.670 || 00:11:27.680 || a food shortage you know the Russia
00:11:30.949 || 00:11:30.959 || Ukraine belt of grains is a big pie is a
00:11:32.449 || 00:11:32.459 || big area it's 30 of the world's
00:11:33.530 || 00:11:33.540 || production
00:11:35.810 || 00:11:35.820 || two of the major producers around the
00:11:38.150 || 00:11:38.160 || globe of Argentina Brazil and and
00:11:40.730 || 00:11:40.740 || Australia had very bad crops a year
00:11:42.170 || 00:11:42.180 || because they're on the opposite
00:11:43.550 || 00:11:43.560 || calendars we are we're going in the
00:11:45.170 || 00:11:45.180 || winter they're going into summer
00:11:47.090 || 00:11:47.100 || weather has been a problem so we have a
00:11:48.889 || 00:11:48.899 || shortage of food you're already seeing
00:11:50.690 || 00:11:50.700 || in the grocery stores five and six
00:11:53.150 || 00:11:53.160 || dollars for a loaf of bread okay so
00:11:54.769 || 00:11:54.779 || what's going to happen I think these are
00:11:56.870 || 00:11:56.880 || going to come to fruition that these
00:11:58.550 || 00:11:58.560 || shortages are going to play because
00:12:01.069 || 00:12:01.079 || demand will out well outweigh Supply
00:12:03.710 || 00:12:03.720 || which will of course drive up prices the
00:12:04.910 || 00:12:04.920 || other point what you're looking at is
00:12:06.590 || 00:12:06.600 || when money comes out
00:12:10.069 || 00:12:10.079 || of equity markets which it will okay it
00:12:11.810 || 00:12:11.820 || goes it's going to go somewhere and
00:12:13.970 || 00:12:13.980 || typically one of the best places for
00:12:16.850 || 00:12:16.860 || money to go is Commodities and then of
00:12:18.230 || 00:12:18.240 || course we get into the gold and silver
00:12:19.730 || 00:12:19.740 || part of the Commodities which are hard
00:12:21.889 || 00:12:21.899 || asset Commodities those are like going
00:12:24.110 || 00:12:24.120 || at home those are some security for
00:12:26.150 || 00:12:26.160 || those who are concerned and at some
00:12:28.670 || 00:12:28.680 || point Elijah we may have to use gold and
00:12:31.310 || 00:12:31.320 || silver as a currency again you know the
00:12:33.590 || 00:12:33.600 || the paper currency is worthless the
00:12:36.230 || 00:12:36.240 || fraudulent fiat currency system is is
00:12:40.389 || 00:12:40.399 || garbage they all want to get to a a
00:12:43.670 || 00:12:43.680 || worldwide digital coin because that will
00:12:45.290 || 00:12:45.300 || allow the central Banker on the globe
00:12:48.170 || 00:12:48.180 || they continue to steal the money okay so
00:12:50.389 || 00:12:50.399 || this is the the problem that you're
00:12:53.210 || 00:12:53.220 || looking at that that that we can't that
00:12:54.889 || 00:12:54.899 || we have not addressed nor does anybody
00:12:56.750 || 00:12:56.760 || want to address it because obviously
00:12:58.310 || 00:12:58.320 || people would get very crazy if they knew
00:12:59.509 || 00:12:59.519 || it was going on
00:13:01.730 || 00:13:01.740 || you mentioned that it seems like we have
00:13:04.129 || 00:13:04.139 || to return to a gold back currency or
00:13:06.050 || 00:13:06.060 || some sort of precious metal backing to
00:13:07.430 || 00:13:07.440 || the currency where we have to use that
00:13:08.990 || 00:13:09.000 || as money and that's what's happened
00:13:10.970 || 00:13:10.980 || throughout history whenever currencies
00:13:13.910 || 00:13:13.920 || die you know people you know uh ask for
00:13:16.190 || 00:13:16.200 || precious metals to be used as money
00:13:18.230 || 00:13:18.240 || again there is speculation about the
00:13:20.389 || 00:13:20.399 || brics Nations doing this do you have any
00:13:23.629 || 00:13:23.639 || uh do you have what's your take on any
00:13:25.850 || 00:13:25.860 || movements you're seeing towards using
00:13:27.470 || 00:13:27.480 || precious metals as money
00:13:29.750 || 00:13:29.760 || no I don't think it'll be I don't think
00:13:32.449 || 00:13:32.459 || you're gonna ever see a back security
00:13:34.790 || 00:13:34.800 || from currency right I don't think the US
00:13:36.889 || 00:13:36.899 || dollar is ever going to be back by gold
00:13:38.629 || 00:13:38.639 || or silver I don't think any of them are
00:13:40.670 || 00:13:40.680 || going to be back I think that the
00:13:42.050 || 00:13:42.060 || central banking system and the Federal
00:13:44.569 || 00:13:44.579 || Reserve are so fraudulent that they
00:13:46.250 || 00:13:46.260 || don't want backing because it takes away
00:13:48.590 || 00:13:48.600 || their ability to steal the old man's
00:13:51.470 || 00:13:51.480 || bundle right that's but I believe that
00:13:52.730 || 00:13:52.740 || you're gonna get you could get to a
00:13:54.290 || 00:13:54.300 || point now again I don't want anybody to
00:13:55.730 || 00:13:55.740 || get crazy and nervous like the world's
00:13:58.310 || 00:13:58.320 || coming around tomorrow but I do believe
00:13:59.150 || 00:13:59.160 || that everybody should have some
00:14:01.129 || 00:14:01.139 || ownership in gold and silver but there
00:14:04.190 || 00:14:04.200 || may be a time that the dollar that you
00:14:05.990 || 00:14:06.000 || have in your pocket is worthless that
00:14:07.250 || 00:14:07.260 || nobody wants to take it anymore and
00:14:08.930 || 00:14:08.940 || they're going to force you to pay gold
00:14:11.389 || 00:14:11.399 || and so and gold or silver you remember a
00:14:12.710 || 00:14:12.720 || hard-ass commodity that you can touch
00:14:15.050 || 00:14:15.060 || feel and look at is a lot better than a
00:14:16.670 || 00:14:16.680 || piece of paper that says a pedal reserve
00:14:18.530 || 00:14:18.540 || note or whatever it says around the rest
00:14:19.730 || 00:14:19.740 || of the door
00:14:22.490 || 00:14:22.500 || and I know a lot of clients ask me this
00:14:25.009 || 00:14:25.019 || question like what will it look like if
00:14:26.509 || 00:14:26.519 || dollars are worthless and you have to
00:14:28.490 || 00:14:28.500 || use precious metals as money we've
00:14:29.990 || 00:14:30.000 || talked about this a little bit before
00:14:31.790 || 00:14:31.800 || that you know junk silver is a great way
00:14:33.129 || 00:14:33.139 || the 90
00:14:36.110 || 00:14:36.120 || constitutional coinage from before 1965
00:14:37.730 || 00:14:37.740 || is a great way to have small
00:14:39.350 || 00:14:39.360 || denominations of silver that you might
00:14:41.090 || 00:14:41.100 || be able to barter with in the future but
00:14:43.310 || 00:14:43.320 || do you have any thought of what that
00:14:45.170 || 00:14:45.180 || kind of system might look like and how
00:14:47.930 || 00:14:47.940 || people can prepare for that I don't
00:14:49.310 || 00:14:49.320 || think you can I really don't think you
00:14:51.110 || 00:14:51.120 || can prepare for it unless you're just a
00:14:53.930 || 00:14:53.940 || a gold and silver buyer as you go along
00:14:56.449 || 00:14:56.459 || right again I believe that you know
00:14:58.009 || 00:14:58.019 || anywhere from five to ten percent of
00:15:00.230 || 00:15:00.240 || your network should be invested in
00:15:02.509 || 00:15:02.519 || precious metals and you know
00:15:04.430 || 00:15:04.440 || unfortunately markets don't make an
00:15:06.050 || 00:15:06.060 || announcement of when the things are
00:15:08.509 || 00:15:08.519 || going to fall and that's the big problem
00:15:10.310 || 00:15:10.320 || right it's like trying to time the
00:15:12.829 || 00:15:12.839 || overall Market when do we collapse I
00:15:14.689 || 00:15:14.699 || don't know okay when does it gonna be
00:15:16.430 || 00:15:16.440 || gold and silver if it is I don't know
00:15:19.430 || 00:15:19.440 || but you can see the hand ring on the
00:15:21.829 || 00:15:21.839 || wall and when paper script becomes
00:15:23.990 || 00:15:24.000 || worthless and is becoming worth less and
00:15:26.269 || 00:15:26.279 || less every day right because of this
00:15:27.949 || 00:15:27.959 || look at your inflation bill again
00:15:30.110 || 00:15:30.120 || there's there's so many tying factors
00:15:32.150 || 00:15:32.160 || here together that we have to be
00:15:34.970 || 00:15:34.980 || prepared for what might happen and the
00:15:36.829 || 00:15:36.839 || good news about holding gold and silver
00:15:39.829 || 00:15:39.839 || is if what I say doesn't happen you're
00:15:41.389 || 00:15:41.399 || holding assets that have appreciated
00:15:43.550 || 00:15:43.560 || over time anyway so you're holding an
00:15:46.610 || 00:15:46.620 || appreciating asset that yeah maybe it's
00:15:48.949 || 00:15:48.959 || based on dollars but again it's still an
00:15:51.290 || 00:15:51.300 || appreciative asset that you may someday
00:15:54.470 || 00:15:54.480 || need to actually eat and that's the one
00:15:55.550 || 00:15:55.560 || thing that I would be concerned about
00:15:57.230 || 00:15:57.240 || and at the top of the interview you
00:16:00.170 || 00:16:00.180 || mentioned how you hedge yourself as well
00:16:03.470 || 00:16:03.480 || against risk can you expand on uh more
00:16:05.629 || 00:16:05.639 || ways ways besides just holding precious
00:16:07.069 || 00:16:07.079 || metals that people can hedge against
00:16:09.769 || 00:16:09.779 || these risks president are not a hedge
00:16:11.329 || 00:16:11.339 || and my again this will be clear where I
00:16:13.370 || 00:16:13.380 || come from president mother on a hedge I
00:16:14.810 || 00:16:14.820 || own precious metals because I think they
00:16:16.490 || 00:16:16.500 || have value it's like I own a home
00:16:17.990 || 00:16:18.000 || because I think it has value I think
00:16:19.730 || 00:16:19.740 || hard assets have value
00:16:22.129 || 00:16:22.139 || when I'm hedging I also head to my gold
00:16:25.370 || 00:16:25.380 || I use derivatives on those products okay
00:16:28.250 || 00:16:28.260 || you know my my current stock portfolio
00:16:30.769 || 00:16:30.779 || let's say you know I hold Apple I can
00:16:33.410 || 00:16:33.420 || hedge using derivatives against apple
00:16:36.530 || 00:16:36.540 || and and take my wrist down from whatever
00:16:39.650 || 00:16:39.660 || it is to two or three percent okay and
00:16:41.749 || 00:16:41.759 || still benefit if the market does go down
00:16:43.670 || 00:16:43.680 || because I'm going to accumulate more
00:16:46.370 || 00:16:46.380 || shares by using the derotos model I
00:16:48.050 || 00:16:48.060 || teach a class I actually teach a class
00:16:50.749 || 00:16:50.759 || in that which is what I do but that's
00:16:53.509 || 00:16:53.519 || what I'm using I'm using derivatives to
00:16:56.329 || 00:16:56.339 || protect and and most almost in today's
00:16:59.569 || 00:16:59.579 || world everything that I can own that can
00:17:02.449 || 00:17:02.459 || use options directly to that security
00:17:05.510 || 00:17:05.520 || that's what I buy today now because I'm
00:17:07.309 || 00:17:07.319 || and I have a business you know I have to
00:17:08.870 || 00:17:08.880 || have a lot of mutual funds as well why
00:17:12.350 || 00:17:12.360 || can beta weight and use the representing
00:17:14.329 || 00:17:14.339 || underlying Securities that represent
00:17:17.210 || 00:17:17.220 || that same mutual fund that most have to
00:17:19.610 || 00:17:19.620 || use if they're using their own 401K into
00:17:22.130 || 00:17:22.140 || business but you can you can take your
00:17:24.890 || 00:17:24.900 || arrest down from X because nobody knows
00:17:27.829 || 00:17:27.839 || what x is but I can I can put you in and
00:17:29.690 || 00:17:29.700 || say you can put your risk at three four
00:17:31.850 || 00:17:31.860 || five percent and that's it and certainly
00:17:34.010 || 00:17:34.020 || 99 of the population can live with three
00:17:35.510 || 00:17:35.520 || four five percent risk if the world does
00:17:36.770 || 00:17:36.780 || come to an end
00:17:38.990 || 00:17:39.000 || and I think that's so interesting the
00:17:40.430 || 00:17:40.440 || way that you do that because you know
00:17:42.230 || 00:17:42.240 || our whole Channel as being a is about
00:17:45.049 || 00:17:45.059 || being aware and prepared and we don't
00:17:46.850 || 00:17:46.860 || really know what's going to happen in
00:17:48.529 || 00:17:48.539 || the future but you're mentioning ways
00:17:50.570 || 00:17:50.580 || that we can really prepare for that and
00:17:53.810 || 00:17:53.820 || reduce our risk if we look at uh kind of
00:17:56.390 || 00:17:56.400 || to wrap up and circle back here to 2023
00:17:57.710 || 00:17:57.720 || this new year
00:17:58.850 || 00:17:58.860 || um did you want to remind our viewers
00:18:00.470 || 00:18:00.480 || some of the main risks that you're
00:18:02.390 || 00:18:02.400 || seeing and ways that people can protect
00:18:03.289 || 00:18:03.299 || themselves
00:18:06.169 || 00:18:06.179 || well I think energy risk is a big thing
00:18:08.210 || 00:18:08.220 || right I mean yeah Kudos back down on 80
00:18:09.770 || 00:18:09.780 || bucks I I think it's going to all-time
00:18:13.370 || 00:18:13.380 || new heising you know Biden has done a
00:18:14.930 || 00:18:14.940 || horrible job with our energy policy of
00:18:15.950 || 00:18:15.960 || course listen when you're getting paid
00:18:17.630 || 00:18:17.640 || off from Saudi and you're getting deals
00:18:18.950 || 00:18:18.960 || from with Venezuela the biggest
00:18:20.990 || 00:18:21.000 || criminals in the world you know I mean
00:18:22.549 || 00:18:22.559 || how much really we think the effect of
00:18:24.590 || 00:18:24.600 || the carbon footprint you know with by
00:18:27.409 || 00:18:27.419 || refining dirty stinky oil from Venezuela
00:18:29.390 || 00:18:29.400 || but I didn't mean that so we have a high
00:18:30.770 || 00:18:30.780 || oil price you're going to have high
00:18:32.150 || 00:18:32.160 || commodity prices you're going to have
00:18:34.010 || 00:18:34.020 || high food prices you're going to have
00:18:35.870 || 00:18:35.880 || less jobs you know we keep eliminating
00:18:37.310 || 00:18:37.320 || jobs you know nobody's talking about
00:18:39.590 || 00:18:39.600 || even the drug shortage that's in this
00:18:40.850 || 00:18:40.860 || country right now we don't have enough
00:18:43.070 || 00:18:43.080 || drugs for the people that need them you
00:18:44.510 || 00:18:44.520 || know there's a lot of shortages across
00:18:46.549 || 00:18:46.559 || the board so this isn't going to look I
00:18:48.590 || 00:18:48.600 || think it looks very ugly and I think it
00:18:50.270 || 00:18:50.280 || gets to a point where you know there's
00:18:51.710 || 00:18:51.720 || not enough jobs they're not making
00:18:53.690 || 00:18:53.700 || enough money and who's going to support
00:18:55.909 || 00:18:55.919 || everything and that's going to be the
00:18:57.350 || 00:18:57.360 || big problem that's kind of like the
00:18:59.150 || 00:18:59.160 || great reset I mean you could almost
00:19:02.390 || 00:19:02.400 || think that the current Administration is
00:19:05.029 || 00:19:05.039 || planning that great reset and trying to
00:19:06.830 || 00:19:06.840 || destroy the middle class just looking at
00:19:08.810 || 00:19:08.820 || small business I mean who who can afford
00:19:10.970 || 00:19:10.980 || to be in small business days so I think
00:19:13.190 || 00:19:13.200 || that's what you want to look into and
00:19:15.770 || 00:19:15.780 || and so your selection of companies or
00:19:17.330 || 00:19:17.340 || who should I be investing in that's
00:19:19.490 || 00:19:19.500 || going to survive throughout all this
00:19:21.169 || 00:19:21.179 || turmoil that's going to come in I mean
00:19:23.810 || 00:19:23.820 || listen if we go totally into communism
00:19:26.029 || 00:19:26.039 || or socialism it doesn't really matter
00:19:29.270 || 00:19:29.280 || it's over okay but hopefully we'll
00:19:32.210 || 00:19:32.220 || realize that we're getting LED down the
00:19:35.270 || 00:19:35.280 || wrong path here okay and that when you
00:19:37.430 || 00:19:37.440 || destroy capitalism you destroy you
00:19:39.890 || 00:19:39.900 || destroy competition you destroy the
00:19:42.409 || 00:19:42.419 || benefit for the average American in this
00:19:45.169 || 00:19:45.179 || case because without competition the
00:19:46.490 || 00:19:46.500 || vendors are free to charge what they
00:19:48.110 || 00:19:48.120 || want and that's where we're that's where
00:19:49.730 || 00:19:49.740 || we're headed and I'm hoping we can head
00:19:51.770 || 00:19:51.780 || this off before it gets to like Todd we
