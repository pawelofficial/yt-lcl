00:00:26.750 || 00:00:26.760 || medals up not so much today but you know
00:00:28.070 || 00:00:28.080 || on the week we're having a nice week
00:00:30.050 || 00:00:30.060 || where in the past when we talk it seems
00:00:31.009 || 00:00:31.019 || like they're always just getting
00:00:33.049 || 00:00:33.059 || obliterated so nice to nice change of
00:00:35.569 || 00:00:35.579 || pace definitely I mean on I believe it
00:00:37.549 || 00:00:37.559 || was Monday we just saw silver surging
00:00:39.950 || 00:00:39.960 || like eight percent or something it was
00:00:41.990 || 00:00:42.000 || crazy we are seeing a bit of a down day
00:00:43.369 || 00:00:43.379 || today but you know what can you expect
00:00:46.670 || 00:00:46.680 || after Rising that much um your take on
00:00:48.350 || 00:00:48.360 || what's happening right now and why is
00:00:51.229 || 00:00:51.239 || silver just surged this week yeah silver
00:00:53.750 || 00:00:53.760 || was up nine percent on Monday and on a
00:00:54.950 || 00:00:54.960 || percentage basis that was the biggest
00:00:57.170 || 00:00:57.180 || update I believe since 2008 so about 14
00:00:59.689 || 00:00:59.699 || years so I I think you know we've
00:01:01.549 || 00:01:01.559 || probably seen the lows in silver
00:01:03.049 || 00:01:03.059 || um what caused that I mean you could say
00:01:04.850 || 00:01:04.860 || point to a lot of things we see some
00:01:07.429 || 00:01:07.439 || central banks starting to Pivot and I
00:01:08.510 || 00:01:08.520 || think it's just a matter of time before
00:01:10.010 || 00:01:10.020 || our own Central Bank does that here in
00:01:11.570 || 00:01:11.580 || the United States but really that beach
00:01:13.490 || 00:01:13.500 || ball was just pushed so far underwater
00:01:15.109 || 00:01:15.119 || that spring had been just so far
00:01:17.570 || 00:01:17.580 || compressed that it was due to pop all
00:01:19.370 || 00:01:19.380 || the ingredients have been in place for a
00:01:21.350 || 00:01:21.360 || major major low in silver and that
00:01:22.609 || 00:01:22.619 || spring just kept getting a little bit
00:01:25.429 || 00:01:25.439 || more compressed you know each week for
00:01:27.410 || 00:01:27.420 || the last you know handful of months and
00:01:29.810 || 00:01:29.820 || then until it popped
00:01:32.149 || 00:01:32.159 || and when it comes to what we're seeing
00:01:33.590 || 00:01:33.600 || right now and silver are there any
00:01:35.569 || 00:01:35.579 || levels specifically that we've broken
00:01:38.510 || 00:01:38.520 || some resistance levels that signaled
00:01:40.730 || 00:01:40.740 || that you know we're not headed to
00:01:42.050 || 00:01:42.060 || further lows because I know a lot of
00:01:43.730 || 00:01:43.740 || people are looking for maybe another
00:01:46.010 || 00:01:46.020 || washout in the metals um but your take
00:01:48.050 || 00:01:48.060 || on where we go from here yeah why don't
00:01:49.370 || 00:01:49.380 || I go ahead and share my screen I'll just
00:01:51.050 || 00:01:51.060 || point out some
00:01:53.450 || 00:01:53.460 || important levels that I think are
00:01:55.969 || 00:01:55.979 || watched by the institutions and the big
00:01:57.530 || 00:01:57.540 || money that really trade off of
00:01:59.450 || 00:01:59.460 || technicals and the big money looks at
00:02:01.609 || 00:02:01.619 || these at these levels in these charts so
00:02:03.170 || 00:02:03.180 || it's important for us to know what those
00:02:04.490 || 00:02:04.500 || levels are
00:02:06.770 || 00:02:06.780 || so what we drop down to a low the low
00:02:11.210 || 00:02:11.220 || here was uh 1740 on Silver and the big
00:02:12.890 || 00:02:12.900 || resistance to get back over here is this
00:02:16.550 || 00:02:16.560 || 22 area that was previous major support
00:02:19.430 || 00:02:19.440 || um 2150 to 22 and it failed and now it's
00:02:21.229 || 00:02:21.239 || resistance so we went almost up to that
00:02:23.930 || 00:02:23.940 || level this past week or um on uh
00:02:25.309 || 00:02:25.319 || yesterday on Tuesday
00:02:26.630 || 00:02:26.640 || now we're pulling back a little bit that
00:02:28.010 || 00:02:28.020 || shouldn't be surprising to anyone
00:02:29.869 || 00:02:29.879 || nothing goes straight up
00:02:32.089 || 00:02:32.099 || and when we look at the daily chart
00:02:33.830 || 00:02:33.840 || here's what I'd be looking for for
00:02:36.470 || 00:02:36.480 || confirmation of a technical reversal
00:02:38.750 || 00:02:38.760 || we broke above this little downtrend
00:02:40.070 || 00:02:40.080 || line here
00:02:41.990 || 00:02:42.000 || on Monday
00:02:43.970 || 00:02:43.980 || and now we've made a higher high above
00:02:47.570 || 00:02:47.580 || 2087. the next uh signal to watch for
00:02:49.130 || 00:02:49.140 || will be a break above this 200-day
00:02:50.690 || 00:02:50.700 || moving average I've talked about this
00:02:52.309 || 00:02:52.319 || poor but 200-day moving average is so
00:02:53.630 || 00:02:53.640 || important because it's probably one of
00:02:55.250 || 00:02:55.260 || the biggest if not the biggest input to
00:02:56.630 || 00:02:56.640 || those trading algorithms that drive
00:02:58.550 || 00:02:58.560 || these paper markets so getting above
00:03:00.050 || 00:03:00.060 || that 200-day moving average would be
00:03:01.190 || 00:03:01.200 || significant
00:03:03.170 || 00:03:03.180 || and um you know after that you've got
00:03:04.910 || 00:03:04.920 || the the big resistance levels up near
00:03:07.550 || 00:03:07.560 || 27.50 and 30. but you know let's worry
00:03:09.470 || 00:03:09.480 || about getting back above 22 which is
00:03:10.790 || 00:03:10.800 || where the 200-day moving average is
00:03:13.070 || 00:03:13.080 || right now first
00:03:15.890 || 00:03:15.900 || now for gold I know I've heard some
00:03:18.949 || 00:03:18.959 || people saying that it broke below
00:03:21.890 || 00:03:21.900 || um a key point just a few weeks ago when
00:03:25.130 || 00:03:25.140 || it went into the 1600s and people are
00:03:27.949 || 00:03:27.959 || expecting it to possibly fall to you
00:03:29.630 || 00:03:29.640 || know the thirteen fourteen hundred
00:03:31.910 || 00:03:31.920 || dollar level now that we have seen this
00:03:34.130 || 00:03:34.140 || rally back is that encouraging in your
00:03:35.330 || 00:03:35.340 || mind or do you think there's still a
00:03:38.509 || 00:03:38.519 || possibility of a great downside for gold
00:03:41.210 || 00:03:41.220 || well I think the risk reward is heavily
00:03:42.890 || 00:03:42.900 || skewed to the upside you know downside
00:03:44.690 || 00:03:44.700 || risk is minimal relative to that upside
00:03:47.330 || 00:03:47.340 || potential but let me show you one thing
00:03:48.949 || 00:03:48.959 || here on this gold chart
00:03:51.110 || 00:03:51.120 || you're right we did break below this
00:03:54.890 || 00:03:54.900 || major major support at 1675 uh last week
00:03:57.050 || 00:03:57.060 || but what's really encouraging is that we
00:03:58.910 || 00:03:58.920 || rallied back above it and some people
00:04:00.770 || 00:04:00.780 || might call that a false breakdown and
00:04:02.330 || 00:04:02.340 || that's actually a Buy Signal when
00:04:04.550 || 00:04:04.560 || support is lost but it doesn't stay
00:04:06.589 || 00:04:06.599 || there and then it reclaims what was
00:04:09.710 || 00:04:09.720 || support as resistance a lot of traders
00:04:12.890 || 00:04:12.900 || buy that breakout back above what was uh
00:04:14.570 || 00:04:14.580 || support and is now resistant so that's
00:04:17.210 || 00:04:17.220 || 1675 that looks to me like a false
00:04:18.469 || 00:04:18.479 || breakdown
00:04:20.449 || 00:04:20.459 || um I think that's what's most the most
00:04:22.009 || 00:04:22.019 || likely scenario you do have this
00:04:24.050 || 00:04:24.060 || downtrend line resistance here and when
00:04:26.150 || 00:04:26.160 || I switch over to the daily chart we're
00:04:27.530 || 00:04:27.540 || still below the 50-day moving average
00:04:29.510 || 00:04:29.520 || and the 200-day moving average there's
00:04:31.370 || 00:04:31.380 || some technical damage obviously in gold
00:04:32.870 || 00:04:32.880 || and silver and we've got some levels to
00:04:34.790 || 00:04:34.800 || reclaim before we can say hey the the
00:04:37.370 || 00:04:37.380 || lows are in for sure but you know I
00:04:38.810 || 00:04:38.820 || think the weight of evidence all the
00:04:40.550 || 00:04:40.560 || pieces of the puzzle are coming
00:04:42.590 || 00:04:42.600 || are lining up to indicate that we are
00:04:44.870 || 00:04:44.880 || very very close to a major low here in
00:04:46.430 || 00:04:46.440 || silver and gold you can look at the cot
00:04:48.050 || 00:04:48.060 || structure the commitment Traders report
00:04:49.969 || 00:04:49.979 || uh sentiment
00:04:51.770 || 00:04:51.780 || all of these things central banks
00:04:53.210 || 00:04:53.220 || starting to Pivot to
00:04:55.670 || 00:04:55.680 || um demand for physical premiums on
00:04:57.710 || 00:04:57.720 || physical metal I'm sure you can speak to
00:04:59.990 || 00:05:00.000 || that even better than I can all the
00:05:01.490 || 00:05:01.500 || pieces are in place for a major low I
00:05:03.050 || 00:05:03.060 || think we're getting very very close we
00:05:05.270 || 00:05:05.280 || haven't been if we're not there already
00:05:07.129 || 00:05:07.139 || it would definitely have just been
00:05:10.670 || 00:05:10.680 || seeing uh premiums increase across the
00:05:12.110 || 00:05:12.120 || board here one of the things that's
00:05:14.330 || 00:05:14.340 || crazy I was just looking at our price
00:05:18.050 || 00:05:18.060 || sheet and the buyback for Silver Eagles
00:05:20.749 || 00:05:20.759 || if you're if you're doing it for a swamp
00:05:23.390 || 00:05:23.400 || into a different product is 11.50 right
00:05:25.070 || 00:05:25.080 || now I've never seen anything like that
00:05:26.150 || 00:05:26.160 || before
00:05:27.890 || 00:05:27.900 || um so it seems like we are seeing
00:05:31.129 || 00:05:31.139 || increase increased premiums and and that
00:05:33.650 || 00:05:33.660 || dramatically uh right now but your
00:05:35.749 || 00:05:35.759 || perspective on kind of some of the
00:05:37.850 || 00:05:37.860 || reasons this week we have seen precious
00:05:40.189 || 00:05:40.199 || metal rise at rise if you could uh
00:05:43.189 || 00:05:43.199 || reminder viewers why we have seen these
00:05:46.310 || 00:05:46.320 || um these prices rise recently uh this
00:05:48.050 || 00:05:48.060 || week I know uh there has been a lot of
00:05:49.790 || 00:05:49.800 || action in bond yields recently in the US
00:05:51.529 || 00:05:51.539 || dollar uh if you could remind our
00:05:52.790 || 00:05:52.800 || viewers about those
00:05:54.469 || 00:05:54.479 || yeah so like I was saying all the pieces
00:05:55.610 || 00:05:55.620 || of the puzzle are starting to fall into
00:05:57.529 || 00:05:57.539 || place for a major low the one thing
00:05:59.390 || 00:05:59.400 || that's been missing is you know
00:06:01.010 || 00:06:01.020 || everyone's been expecting this fed pivot
00:06:03.770 || 00:06:03.780 || and Powell has continued until recently
00:06:06.529 || 00:06:06.539 || to talk tough hey we're gonna we're
00:06:08.450 || 00:06:08.460 || prepared to inflict pain on the economy
00:06:10.249 || 00:06:10.259 || we're gonna Crush inflation on the next
00:06:12.890 || 00:06:12.900 || Paul volcker he's uh he's not the next
00:06:14.870 || 00:06:14.880 || Paul volcker and I continue to believe
00:06:16.550 || 00:06:16.560 || he's going to Flinch not because he
00:06:18.230 || 00:06:18.240 || wants to but because they have to it's
00:06:20.629 || 00:06:20.639 || just math and let's talk about that fed
00:06:22.610 || 00:06:22.620 || pivot for a minute because
00:06:24.469 || 00:06:24.479 || that means a lot of different things to
00:06:25.909 || 00:06:25.919 || a lot of different people
00:06:27.650 || 00:06:27.660 || I'm in the camp of saying hey they're
00:06:29.090 || 00:06:29.100 || going to Pivot probably sooner than many
00:06:31.070 || 00:06:31.080 || people think and you know other people
00:06:32.570 || 00:06:32.580 || might say hey that's ridiculous you're
00:06:33.290 || 00:06:33.300 || wrong
00:06:34.550 || 00:06:34.560 || but I think in their mind they might
00:06:35.749 || 00:06:35.759 || think when I say that that I mean
00:06:37.850 || 00:06:37.860 || they're going to go go from what they're
00:06:39.409 || 00:06:39.419 || doing now to just full-on debt
00:06:41.990 || 00:06:42.000 || monetization QE on steroids all that
00:06:44.150 || 00:06:44.160 || you know turn on a dime and do that I
00:06:45.950 || 00:06:45.960 || don't think that's the case to me the
00:06:48.170 || 00:06:48.180 || pivot is when they slow when they go
00:06:50.930 || 00:06:50.940 || from 75 to 50 to 25 basis point hikes
00:06:52.850 || 00:06:52.860 || and then probably pause and then
00:06:54.469 || 00:06:54.479 || sometime maybe next year is when they
00:06:56.570 || 00:06:56.580 || turn on the spigots again but gold and
00:06:57.890 || 00:06:57.900 || silver are going to see all that in
00:06:59.210 || 00:06:59.220 || advance and I think they're starting to
00:07:01.909 || 00:07:01.919 || sniff that out right now that you know
00:07:05.270 || 00:07:05.280 || the the the the rate hike rate hike
00:07:07.610 || 00:07:07.620 || rhetoric is probably peaked and they're
00:07:09.409 || 00:07:09.419 || going to start to take their foot off
00:07:11.330 || 00:07:11.340 || the gas on that kind of talk and I think
00:07:12.950 || 00:07:12.960 || gold and silver are sniffing that out
00:07:14.270 || 00:07:14.280 || right now
00:07:16.670 || 00:07:16.680 || and when we look at the miners as well
00:07:19.309 || 00:07:19.319 || what kind of action are we seeing there
00:07:21.230 || 00:07:21.240 || yeah I mean if the metals have been
00:07:23.210 || 00:07:23.220 || obliterated which they have mining
00:07:24.710 || 00:07:24.720 || stocks have been even more obliterated
00:07:26.330 || 00:07:26.340 || especially the junior silver mining
00:07:27.469 || 00:07:27.479 || stocks
00:07:29.870 || 00:07:29.880 || um I still think these things are a
00:07:32.089 || 00:07:32.099 || tremendous present tremendous value
00:07:33.650 || 00:07:33.660 || proposition for those who can handle the
00:07:35.409 || 00:07:35.419 || risk and have the proper time Horizon
00:07:38.029 || 00:07:38.039 || that's where you can see
00:07:40.070 || 00:07:40.080 || the money I've made personally in these
00:07:41.570 || 00:07:41.580 || sectors is buying at times like this
00:07:43.129 || 00:07:43.139 || when they're just hated no one even
00:07:45.650 || 00:07:45.660 || wants to look at these things anymore
00:07:46.969 || 00:07:46.979 || um unfortunately you know the average
00:07:48.950 || 00:07:48.960 || person average retail investor they want
00:07:50.150 || 00:07:50.160 || to buy them when they're everyone's
00:07:51.350 || 00:07:51.360 || talking about them they're hot on social
00:07:53.210 || 00:07:53.220 || media but when they're hated you know
00:07:55.010 || 00:07:55.020 || it's when the guys like Rick rule the
00:07:56.809 || 00:07:56.819 || successful contrarian investors are out
00:07:58.969 || 00:07:58.979 || buying and you know I'm scaling in
00:08:00.290 || 00:08:00.300 || myself here
00:08:02.029 || 00:08:02.039 || it definitely does seem like sentiment
00:08:04.070 || 00:08:04.080 || is extremely low right now
00:08:06.890 || 00:08:06.900 || um even even as you know we've seen this
00:08:08.330 || 00:08:08.340 || rally right now people are talking about
00:08:10.969 || 00:08:10.979 || how it could fall lower from here but it
00:08:12.290 || 00:08:12.300 || seems like yeah this is kind of the
00:08:14.029 || 00:08:14.039 || environment that you want this is the
00:08:15.890 || 00:08:15.900 || kind of talk you want to see right now
00:08:18.589 || 00:08:18.599 || if you are a contrarian right this is
00:08:21.170 || 00:08:21.180 || the exact environment you want to be
00:08:23.450 || 00:08:23.460 || um in because you don't want to be in
00:08:25.909 || 00:08:25.919 || something where everyone is jumping in
00:08:27.890 || 00:08:27.900 || you want to be in something where
00:08:30.050 || 00:08:30.060 || everyone hates at the moment yeah
00:08:32.269 || 00:08:32.279 || there's uh I don't have the chart in
00:08:34.130 || 00:08:34.140 || front of me but it's called the bullish
00:08:37.670 || 00:08:37.680 || percent gold miners index and that index
00:08:39.529 || 00:08:39.539 || um late last week fell below where it
00:08:42.230 || 00:08:42.240 || was in March of 2020 that's how poor
00:08:44.449 || 00:08:44.459 || sentiment is in the sector and
00:08:46.610 || 00:08:46.620 || historically that's always been a great
00:08:48.050 || 00:08:48.060 || opportunity to buy it doesn't mean you
00:08:49.009 || 00:08:49.019 || can't go a little bit lower that's
00:08:51.650 || 00:08:51.660 || always possible and just one quick
00:08:53.090 || 00:08:53.100 || comment is
00:08:55.009 || 00:08:55.019 || because we've been in the doldrums here
00:08:57.710 || 00:08:57.720 || for a handful of months and quarters and
00:08:59.030 || 00:08:59.040 || I might it might seem like I'm saying
00:09:00.530 || 00:09:00.540 || the same thing and I have and we've
00:09:03.350 || 00:09:03.360 || continued to make lower lows and you
00:09:04.790 || 00:09:04.800 || know that can make me look foolish I'm
00:09:06.769 || 00:09:06.779 || okay with that but I'm not here to be
00:09:08.810 || 00:09:08.820 || like a permeable I remember what you and
00:09:10.310 || 00:09:10.320 || I speaking you know a year or two ago
00:09:11.990 || 00:09:12.000 || when they first started talking about
00:09:13.250 || 00:09:13.260 || rate hikes and I said yeah I think
00:09:14.389 || 00:09:14.399 || they're probably going to do it when no
00:09:15.590 || 00:09:15.600 || one did
00:09:17.570 || 00:09:17.580 || um you know and back in August of 2020 I
00:09:19.130 || 00:09:19.140 || was very cautious on the sector saying
00:09:20.870 || 00:09:20.880 || hey we're due for a pullback I'm not
00:09:22.490 || 00:09:22.500 || saying that to say Pat my back to say
00:09:24.050 || 00:09:24.060 || hey I get the turns right but I'm also
00:09:25.790 || 00:09:25.800 || saying I'm just being objective I'm not
00:09:27.350 || 00:09:27.360 || always going to say
00:09:29.269 || 00:09:29.279 || metals are you know close to a bottom
00:09:30.410 || 00:09:30.420 || they're only going to go up that's not
00:09:31.850 || 00:09:31.860 || what I'm here to do but I genuinely
00:09:33.470 || 00:09:33.480 || believe that right now that this is a
00:09:35.210 || 00:09:35.220 || really good opportunity
00:09:37.190 || 00:09:37.200 || and I knew you've pointed out many times
00:09:39.230 || 00:09:39.240 || in the past that the downside for
00:09:42.050 || 00:09:42.060 || example for silver is very low but the
00:09:45.650 || 00:09:45.660 || upside is is very like there's a huge
00:09:48.050 || 00:09:48.060 || upside potential for silver is that
00:09:49.850 || 00:09:49.860 || still your view like what do you think
00:09:51.710 || 00:09:51.720 || the downside potential is versus the
00:09:53.150 || 00:09:53.160 || potential upside that we're looking at
00:09:54.949 || 00:09:54.959 || right now yeah I think that's a this is
00:09:56.150 || 00:09:56.160 || a great way to think about it if you've
00:09:57.710 || 00:09:57.720 || got a one plus your time Horizon and
00:09:59.329 || 00:09:59.339 || this could all unfold much sooner than a
00:10:01.430 || 00:10:01.440 || year let's just call it that
00:10:02.630 || 00:10:02.640 || um what's the downside risk in silver
00:10:05.170 || 00:10:05.180 || maybe three bucks I mean
00:10:07.550 || 00:10:07.560 || somewhere around there maybe four at the
00:10:09.410 || 00:10:09.420 || most but if you think silver is going to
00:10:10.850 || 00:10:10.860 || 50 and I think that's conservative
00:10:13.670 || 00:10:13.680 || that's 30 dollars of upside so three
00:10:15.650 || 00:10:15.660 || dollars of downside 30 on the upside
00:10:17.509 || 00:10:17.519 || that's a ten to one risk reward ratio
00:10:20.150 || 00:10:20.160 || and you know anyone it's a Wall Street
00:10:21.710 || 00:10:21.720 || Trader or investor you know a
00:10:23.210 || 00:10:23.220 || professional looks at those risk reward
00:10:25.430 || 00:10:25.440 || and they call an asymmetric setup I
00:10:26.750 || 00:10:26.760 || don't think there's a more asymmetric
00:10:28.430 || 00:10:28.440 || setup right now right here right now
00:10:30.410 || 00:10:30.420 || than in silver
00:10:32.690 || 00:10:32.700 || and if we could get also into what is
00:10:34.850 || 00:10:34.860 || happening on the physical Market we see
00:10:37.850 || 00:10:37.860 || uh the stories of how you know there's a
00:10:40.430 || 00:10:40.440 || lot of physical deliveries off the comex
00:10:42.650 || 00:10:42.660 || right now we're seeing premiums in the
00:10:46.310 || 00:10:46.320 || physical Market just Skyrocket last week
00:10:48.290 || 00:10:48.300 || um so here at Miles Franklin they always
00:10:50.930 || 00:10:50.940 || send the Brokers the price sheets
00:10:52.670 || 00:10:52.680 || um and we got a couple last week because
00:10:55.009 || 00:10:55.019 || premiums were moving so fast and then we
00:10:56.329 || 00:10:56.339 || were told you know just be careful
00:10:57.949 || 00:10:57.959 || because you know premiums are increasing
00:10:59.630 || 00:10:59.640 || on the wholesale side
00:11:01.370 || 00:11:01.380 || um so you know sending a price sheet
00:11:02.870 || 00:11:02.880 || doesn't really make sense at this moment
00:11:04.670 || 00:11:04.680 || because it's going to change too fast
00:11:07.190 || 00:11:07.200 || and we're continuing to just see them uh
00:11:08.990 || 00:11:09.000 || creep up here but your perspective on
00:11:10.490 || 00:11:10.500 || that the physical versus the paper
00:11:12.650 || 00:11:12.660 || market and what is really happening in
00:11:14.569 || 00:11:14.579 || the physical market right now
00:11:16.250 || 00:11:16.260 || yeah I'm not going to speak to the
00:11:17.810 || 00:11:17.820 || specifics because that's not really my
00:11:19.610 || 00:11:19.620 || area of expertise but I talk to people
00:11:21.230 || 00:11:21.240 || like you and I'm on email chains with
00:11:23.870 || 00:11:23.880 || other industry analysts and I mean it is
00:11:27.829 || 00:11:27.839 || obvious that there is massive demand for
00:11:29.750 || 00:11:29.760 || physical metal right now coming from not
00:11:31.970 || 00:11:31.980 || just retail but institutions of smart
00:11:33.410 || 00:11:33.420 || money you can see the commitment to
00:11:35.150 || 00:11:35.160 || trace report is buying the physical hand
00:11:37.670 || 00:11:37.680 || over fist while retail tends to just
00:11:39.230 || 00:11:39.240 || puke it out and that's where it's coming
00:11:41.030 || 00:11:41.040 || from but it's also important to make
00:11:42.290 || 00:11:42.300 || this distinction we've done this before
00:11:43.850 || 00:11:43.860 || but when we look at the price of silver
00:11:46.610 || 00:11:46.620 || sitting at 21 what we're seeing is a
00:11:48.170 || 00:11:48.180 || price that's based on supply and demand
00:11:49.730 || 00:11:49.740 || and paper contracts that could be issued
00:11:51.350 || 00:11:51.360 || at will on the Commodities exchange or
00:11:54.170 || 00:11:54.180 || the comex it has very little if any
00:11:55.670 || 00:11:55.680 || resemblance to the supply and demand
00:11:57.769 || 00:11:57.779 || fundamentals of physical metal and you
00:11:59.329 || 00:11:59.339 || see that with the rising premiums you're
00:12:00.590 || 00:12:00.600 || talking about silver eagles with 11
00:12:04.069 || 00:12:04.079 || premiums well if it costs you thirty
00:12:05.210 || 00:12:05.220 || dollars to get your hands on a physical
00:12:07.550 || 00:12:07.560 || piece of silver but your paper price
00:12:09.410 || 00:12:09.420 || says 20. what's the price of silver well
00:12:12.190 || 00:12:12.200 || I would say it's 30 closer to 30 anyway
00:12:15.230 || 00:12:15.240 || hopefully that was a I might on tangent
00:12:16.910 || 00:12:16.920 || there but those are my general thoughts
00:12:19.130 || 00:12:19.140 || right I mean closer to 35 right now
00:12:21.829 || 00:12:21.839 || because the 1150 is the buyback price
00:12:24.530 || 00:12:24.540 || for a swap if you're selling us back
00:12:26.870 || 00:12:26.880 || Silver Eagles right now 11.50 if you're
00:12:28.190 || 00:12:28.200 || swapping into a different product but
00:12:30.350 || 00:12:30.360 || the silver eagles on the buy side it's I
00:12:32.210 || 00:12:32.220 || think it's around like 15 or something
00:12:33.710 || 00:12:33.720 || right now so it's like yeah if you do
00:12:35.150 || 00:12:35.160 || want to get your hand on an
00:12:37.069 || 00:12:37.079 || American-made silver product you're
00:12:39.290 || 00:12:39.300 || looking at like 35 right now which is
00:12:40.610 || 00:12:40.620 || just insane
00:12:42.290 || 00:12:42.300 || yeah absolutely
00:12:44.030 || 00:12:44.040 || um so like I said all the pieces of the
00:12:45.949 || 00:12:45.959 || puzzle are lining up for a major load
00:12:48.290 || 00:12:48.300 || this is a to me I mean a fantastic
00:12:49.730 || 00:12:49.740 || opportunity I'm
00:12:51.470 || 00:12:51.480 || trying to free up as much cash as I can
00:12:53.810 || 00:12:53.820 || to put my money where my mouth is so I'm
00:12:56.329 || 00:12:56.339 || a strong buyer down here
00:12:58.610 || 00:12:58.620 || and if we do look at the fundamentals of
00:13:00.110 || 00:13:00.120 || what we're seeing in the economy right
00:13:02.210 || 00:13:02.220 || now we have a comment from a viewer Greg
00:13:04.550 || 00:13:04.560 || talking about how the UK has already
00:13:07.670 || 00:13:07.680 || pivoted but the US has not your
00:13:10.670 || 00:13:10.680 || perspective on that and is maybe what
00:13:13.250 || 00:13:13.260 || we're seeing happening in the UK maybe
00:13:15.170 || 00:13:15.180 || foreshadowing what we could see in the
00:13:19.550 || 00:13:19.560 || U.S yes 100 and when we talk about a
00:13:20.690 || 00:13:20.700 || pivot
00:13:22.430 || 00:13:22.440 || there's a there's reasons that I think
00:13:24.949 || 00:13:24.959 || get overlooked one reason they're going
00:13:27.110 || 00:13:27.120 || to Pivot is to boost boost asset prices
00:13:28.550 || 00:13:28.560 || and that's what gets the most attention
00:13:31.250 || 00:13:31.260 || people see real estate kind of crashing
00:13:34.910 || 00:13:34.920 || stock market tanking uh bonds crashing
00:13:36.050 || 00:13:36.060 || and they say oh we got to boost that up
00:13:39.470 || 00:13:39.480 || and that's true but also we run a one
00:13:41.870 || 00:13:41.880 || trillion dollar plus deficit every year
00:13:44.030 || 00:13:44.040 || who is going to fund that deficit who's
00:13:45.710 || 00:13:45.720 || going to fund it
00:13:47.710 || 00:13:47.720 || um China's stepping back Saudi Arabia
00:13:50.150 || 00:13:50.160 || stepping back from funding our deficit
00:13:51.769 || 00:13:51.779 || while the FED is going to be the buyer
00:13:53.990 || 00:13:54.000 || of Last Resort the alternative is
00:13:56.150 || 00:13:56.160 || interest rates run out of control and
00:13:58.490 || 00:13:58.500 || with a 31 now 31 trillion dollar
00:14:00.710 || 00:14:00.720 || national debt every one percent rise in
00:14:02.690 || 00:14:02.700 || interest rates adds 310 billion dollars
00:14:04.610 || 00:14:04.620 || to interest expenses every single year
00:14:07.190 || 00:14:07.200 || so you know if we go to a five percent
00:14:08.870 || 00:14:08.880 || interest rate just for easy math that's
00:14:11.569 || 00:14:11.579 || over 1.5 trillion dollars a year
00:14:13.790 || 00:14:13.800 || of interest payments on our national
00:14:16.490 || 00:14:16.500 || debt that that can't happen the math
00:14:17.870 || 00:14:17.880 || doesn't work
00:14:19.730 || 00:14:19.740 || um the FED can't let that happen unless
00:14:21.290 || 00:14:21.300 || they want to just crash everything but
00:14:22.730 || 00:14:22.740 || if they did that then you know they
00:14:24.350 || 00:14:24.360 || would get the blame for it whereas if
00:14:26.210 || 00:14:26.220 || they inflate the debt away and debase
00:14:27.949 || 00:14:27.959 || the currency people don't understand it
00:14:29.629 || 00:14:29.639 || and they blame each other they blame
00:14:33.170 || 00:14:33.180 || every everyone who shouldn't get blamed
00:14:35.210 || 00:14:35.220 || gets blamed so that's why they choose to
00:14:36.350 || 00:14:36.360 || inflate
00:14:39.470 || 00:14:39.480 || um inflate every time
00:14:41.689 || 00:14:41.699 || no when it comes to what is happening in
00:14:43.430 || 00:14:43.440 || the markets uh for example the stock
00:14:45.710 || 00:14:45.720 || market we are seeing quite a bit of a
00:14:48.110 || 00:14:48.120 || downturn there and it seems like we may
00:14:50.389 || 00:14:50.399 || be headed towards you know just falling
00:14:52.069 || 00:14:52.079 || off a cliff there
00:14:53.930 || 00:14:53.940 || um now your perspective on that because
00:14:55.490 || 00:14:55.500 || it seems like when we do see a pullback
00:14:57.170 || 00:14:57.180 || in the stock market
00:14:59.569 || 00:14:59.579 || um we do see precious metals fall as
00:15:01.790 || 00:15:01.800 || well but then they reverse usually
00:15:04.730 || 00:15:04.740 || before the stock market reverses
00:15:06.829 || 00:15:06.839 || um so first where do you see the stock
00:15:08.810 || 00:15:08.820 || market heading and could what we're
00:15:10.970 || 00:15:10.980 || seeing right now in this precious metals
00:15:13.310 || 00:15:13.320 || be that reversal of precious metals
00:15:15.410 || 00:15:15.420 || before the stock market reverses
00:15:18.530 || 00:15:18.540 || yeah I I do trade the general indices
00:15:22.970 || 00:15:22.980 || but you know um it's kind of hard to
00:15:25.069 || 00:15:25.079 || answer that question exactly because I
00:15:26.990 || 00:15:27.000 || can easily see a scenario where stocks
00:15:28.310 || 00:15:28.320 || Trend higher over in the coming years
00:15:30.650 || 00:15:30.660 || but they underperform everything else
00:15:32.629 || 00:15:32.639 || but they would Trend higher because of
00:15:35.030 || 00:15:35.040 || um all the currency creation
00:15:36.470 || 00:15:36.480 || um so you know if the stock market
00:15:38.090 || 00:15:38.100 || doubles but everything else quadruples
00:15:39.530 || 00:15:39.540 || did the stock market double or did it
00:15:41.329 || 00:15:41.339 || lose half its value I would say lost
00:15:43.730 || 00:15:43.740 || half its value but over the short term
00:15:46.550 || 00:15:46.560 || here I think as the the market starts to
00:15:48.350 || 00:15:48.360 || sniff out a Fed pivot coming in the
00:15:49.550 || 00:15:49.560 || quarters ahead
00:15:51.769 || 00:15:51.779 || stocks stocks could have one more pop
00:15:53.449 || 00:15:53.459 || they could even go and make new Highs
00:15:55.430 || 00:15:55.440 || but in the longer term they are
00:15:56.810 || 00:15:56.820 || extremely overvalued I mean this is
00:15:58.310 || 00:15:58.320 || about the most overvalued stock market
00:16:00.470 || 00:16:00.480 || we've ever seen especially when you
00:16:02.210 || 00:16:02.220 || compare it to hard assets if you run
00:16:05.030 || 00:16:05.040 || ratio charts Dow versus gold
00:16:07.910 || 00:16:07.920 || um Dow versus silver Dow versus platinum
00:16:10.490 || 00:16:10.500 || um you'll see come on you can put it you
00:16:11.629 || 00:16:11.639 || can phrase this one or two ways
00:16:12.889 || 00:16:12.899 || Commodities have never been so
00:16:14.750 || 00:16:14.760 || undervalued relative to General equities
00:16:16.730 || 00:16:16.740 || or general equities have never been more
00:16:19.129 || 00:16:19.139 || overvalued relative to hard assets
00:16:20.930 || 00:16:20.940 || so that that's where the risk that's
00:16:23.150 || 00:16:23.160 || where the value is hard assets not not
00:16:24.889 || 00:16:24.899 || the stock market for sure
00:16:27.590 || 00:16:27.600 || and we definitely have seen incredibly
00:16:29.750 || 00:16:29.760 || strange valuations
00:16:31.970 || 00:16:31.980 || um in the stock market and as they say
00:16:33.590 || 00:16:33.600 || don't fight the Fed so if we do see a
00:16:34.850 || 00:16:34.860 || pivot it's very possible as you
00:16:36.110 || 00:16:36.120 || mentioned that they we could see new
00:16:37.910 || 00:16:37.920 || highs for the stock market
00:16:39.769 || 00:16:39.779 || um but Steve if people are interested in
00:16:41.389 || 00:16:41.399 || learning more they can go to

00:17:01.610 || 00:17:01.620 || transparent over-the-shoulder service
00:17:03.650 || 00:17:03.660 || with real-time alerts so I show the
00:17:05.210 || 00:17:05.220 || members exactly what I'm doing with my
00:17:06.230 || 00:17:06.240 || own money
00:17:07.429 || 00:17:07.439 || um it doesn't mean I get everything
00:17:09.169 || 00:17:09.179 || correct you know you see the mistakes I
00:17:10.490 || 00:17:10.500 || make as well but hopefully that
00:17:13.189 || 00:17:13.199 || transparent look helps people to make
00:17:15.110 || 00:17:15.120 || wiser decisions in their own investing
00:17:18.049 || 00:17:18.059 || in financial planning and uh one thing
00:17:19.490 || 00:17:19.500 || that's also maybe a little bit unique is
00:17:22.429 || 00:17:22.439 || I take 10 of the overall portfolio and I
00:17:25.309 || 00:17:25.319 || trade it for with the goal of monthly
00:17:27.289 || 00:17:27.299 || cash flow so we also do a little bit of
00:17:29.450 || 00:17:29.460 || trading around the core positions
00:17:31.190 || 00:17:31.200 || all right and any last thoughts before
00:17:32.930 || 00:17:32.940 || we let you go Steve
00:17:36.470 || 00:17:36.480 || no uh for those who have you know hung
00:17:39.409 || 00:17:39.419 || on to the silver uh for this last two
00:17:41.750 || 00:17:41.760 || years that's just been brutal we've seen
00:17:43.850 || 00:17:43.860 || plenty of downside volatility that
00:17:45.289 || 00:17:45.299 || volatility is going to reverse we are
00:17:46.970 || 00:17:46.980 || going to see upside volatility as well
00:17:49.430 || 00:17:49.440 || so I would say just uh hang on know the
00:17:50.870 || 00:17:50.880 || reasons that you got into the sector in
00:17:52.970 || 00:17:52.980 || the first place and all of those reasons
00:17:54.650 || 00:17:54.660 || are still valid
00:17:57.169 || 00:17:57.179 || it definitely is a wild ride and anyone
00:17:59.510 || 00:17:59.520 || who invested in silver is invested in
00:18:01.850 || 00:18:01.860 || silver should probably know that silver
00:18:04.250 || 00:18:04.260 || is is quite a wild ride and it should be
00:18:05.930 || 00:18:05.940 || very exciting to continue to track this
00:18:07.250 || 00:18:07.260 || Stephen thank you so much for your time
