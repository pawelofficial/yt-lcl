00:00:02.210 || 00:00:02.220 || but when that comes Unwound
00:00:04.610 || 00:00:04.620 || money will go somewhere it's already
00:00:06.650 || 00:00:06.660 || started to and I think you're going to
00:00:08.330 || 00:00:08.340 || see a dramatic move into gold and silver
00:00:11.509 || 00:00:11.519 || with silvery by far the leader as it's
00:00:13.850 || 00:00:13.860 || been actually since September uh late
00:00:15.910 || 00:00:15.920 || September it's shifted against gold
00:00:18.470 || 00:00:18.480 || favoring silver again and sure enough
00:00:19.670 || 00:00:19.680 || since then
00:00:21.470 || 00:00:21.480 || you've had that out performance by
00:00:22.750 || 00:00:22.760 || silver
00:00:25.370 || 00:00:25.380 || so we think that's the main focus for
00:00:27.170 || 00:00:27.180 || next year on the long side as far as the
00:00:28.550 || 00:00:28.560 || short side basically you could throw a
00:00:31.849 || 00:00:31.859 || dart if it's a paper asset be careful

00:01:47.330 || 00:01:47.340 || popular guest Michael Oliver from
00:01:49.670 || 00:01:49.680 || momentum structural analysis Michael
00:01:51.109 || 00:01:51.119 || thank you so much for joining us today
00:01:53.330 || 00:01:53.340 || hi Elijah good to be here well it's
00:01:55.130 || 00:01:55.140 || great to have you and we're entering
00:01:58.550 || 00:01:58.560 || into the new year here 2023 we've had a
00:02:01.069 || 00:02:01.079 || wild ride in both in all the markets it
00:02:03.469 || 00:02:03.479 || seems like the stock market uh the US
00:02:05.990 || 00:02:06.000 || dollar gold and silver
00:02:07.969 || 00:02:07.979 || um to give kind of a review of the year
00:02:10.070 || 00:02:10.080 || what Market would you like to start with
00:02:13.130 || 00:02:13.140 || oh well I I think that the the most
00:02:15.050 || 00:02:15.060 || important one going forward is going to
00:02:16.550 || 00:02:16.560 || be gold and silver with silver in the
00:02:17.830 || 00:02:17.840 || lead but
00:02:21.410 || 00:02:21.420 || we've been noting as the year progressed
00:02:23.270 || 00:02:23.280 || where we are year to date you know
00:02:24.470 || 00:02:24.480 || because everybody's screaming that
00:02:25.850 || 00:02:25.860 || everything is going to go down because
00:02:27.650 || 00:02:27.660 || the fed's in charge and all this stuff
00:02:29.570 || 00:02:29.580 || well if they're in charge how come the
00:02:32.449 || 00:02:32.459 || Bloomberg's up about what 13 14 on the
00:02:34.190 || 00:02:34.200 || year and that's a pullback
00:02:36.229 || 00:02:36.239 || how come gold is effectively trading
00:02:38.210 || 00:02:38.220 || right now with uh with an hour to go
00:02:41.150 || 00:02:41.160 || left in the day before settlement down
00:02:42.830 || 00:02:42.840 || two bucks on the year
00:02:45.350 || 00:02:45.360 || okay you know and Silver's up three
00:02:47.270 || 00:02:47.280 || three or four percent on the year
00:02:49.250 || 00:02:49.260 || and yet quote they're fighting inflation
00:02:51.410 || 00:02:51.420 || well they are fighting inflation
00:02:53.270 || 00:02:53.280 || they're fighting a dozen year inflation
00:02:55.430 || 00:02:55.440 || bubble that they created with monetary
00:02:58.190 || 00:02:58.200 || policy free money helicopter money qes
00:03:01.729 || 00:03:01.739 || you name it and therefore all that money
00:03:03.170 || 00:03:03.180 || went somewhere
00:03:05.869 || 00:03:05.879 || and investors and asset managers chose
00:03:07.490 || 00:03:07.500 || to put it in the stock market back in
00:03:10.070 || 00:03:10.080 || 2009 which actually from our perspective
00:03:11.509 || 00:03:11.519 || made sense because we turned very
00:03:14.750 || 00:03:14.760 || bullish in March 2009 in fact we one
00:03:16.550 || 00:03:16.560 || week before the low we said the low will
00:03:19.729 || 00:03:19.739 || be around 670. okay with 668. you know
00:03:22.790 || 00:03:22.800 || until 667 s p
00:03:25.430 || 00:03:25.440 || um but then that upside didn't just go
00:03:26.869 || 00:03:26.879 || up for a couple years it went up
00:03:29.990 || 00:03:30.000 || Sevenfold over a dozen years in the s p
00:03:34.369 || 00:03:34.379 || it went up 16-fold for the NASDAQ 100.
00:03:36.649 || 00:03:36.659 || so it was a bubble like we've never seen
00:03:38.869 || 00:03:38.879 || in the U.S stock market history
00:03:41.390 || 00:03:41.400 || go back to the 1920s through 1929
00:03:44.149 || 00:03:44.159 || doesn't compare in terms of how much up
00:03:46.089 || 00:03:46.099 || was that bull market before it broke
00:03:48.830 || 00:03:48.840 || the.com bubble didn't have an advanced
00:03:51.530 || 00:03:51.540 || anywhere near like what we've just seen
00:03:54.110 || 00:03:54.120 || the real estate bust that occurred in
00:03:55.789 || 00:03:55.799 || 2007 and eight
00:03:57.589 || 00:03:57.599 || didn't have anything like the advance
00:04:00.170 || 00:04:00.180 || that we've seen over the last Dozen
00:04:01.190 || 00:04:01.200 || Years
00:04:03.050 || 00:04:03.060 || so we have a major bubble and they've
00:04:04.610 || 00:04:04.620 || broken it so they have in fact fought
00:04:06.890 || 00:04:06.900 || inflation if you define inflation
00:04:08.990 || 00:04:09.000 || properly meaning broadly when you
00:04:10.429 || 00:04:10.439 || increase the money supply it goes
00:04:14.210 || 00:04:14.220 || somewhere well it investors put it there
00:04:16.310 || 00:04:16.320 || however during this year you can see
00:04:19.129 || 00:04:19.139 || that that has changed because month by
00:04:21.469 || 00:04:21.479 || Bloody month the stock market stays down
00:04:24.650 || 00:04:24.660 || the nasdaq's down with 30 s p is down
00:04:28.129 || 00:04:28.139 || about 20 goals unchanged well you know
00:04:30.110 || 00:04:30.120 || as we've seen the year progress gold has
00:04:32.330 || 00:04:32.340 || gone from up on the year down on the
00:04:33.110 || 00:04:33.120 || year
00:04:36.890 || 00:04:36.900 || knows it closed last year in 1828 by the
00:04:37.490 || 00:04:37.500 || way
00:04:38.930 || 00:04:38.940 || so went up a couple hundred bucks early
00:04:40.850 || 00:04:40.860 || in the year then we went down unchanged
00:04:42.230 || 00:04:42.240 || on the years went down a couple hundred
00:04:43.969 || 00:04:43.979 || bucks so it's been up a couple hundred
00:04:45.230 || 00:04:45.240 || down a couple hundred right now we're
00:04:47.090 || 00:04:47.100 || right in the middle where we closed a
00:04:50.510 || 00:04:50.520 || year ago so some some reason
00:04:53.090 || 00:04:53.100 || there are good reasons some reason some
00:04:55.189 || 00:04:55.199 || investors particularly large asset
00:04:57.469 || 00:04:57.479 || managers like gold
00:04:58.969 || 00:04:58.979 || and they've been moving money out of
00:05:00.950 || 00:05:00.960 || stocks and into gold
00:05:03.110 || 00:05:03.120 || no gold isn't beating its chest but gold
00:05:05.450 || 00:05:05.460 || isn't going down
00:05:08.930 || 00:05:08.940 || and silver is actually up on the air
00:05:11.810 || 00:05:11.820 || so I think that's a statement I think
00:05:14.330 || 00:05:14.340 || gold knows something now what might it
00:05:19.850 || 00:05:19.860 || that the FED has broken something so
00:05:21.070 || 00:05:21.080 || huge
00:05:24.950 || 00:05:24.960 || that they will have to turn and pivot at
00:05:27.950 || 00:05:27.960 || some point probably early in this year
00:05:30.469 || 00:05:30.479 || to defend certain key assets that are
00:05:31.730 || 00:05:31.740 || imploded
00:05:34.490 || 00:05:34.500 || at Key assets from their perspective you
00:05:35.930 || 00:05:35.940 || know they don't care about corn Farmers
00:05:38.810 || 00:05:38.820 || making money that's a bit bad okay but
00:05:40.610 || 00:05:40.620 || making money in the stock market or in
00:05:42.409 || 00:05:42.419 || uni bonds or the paper paper prices
00:05:44.029 || 00:05:44.039 || going up that's okay with them well
00:05:47.029 || 00:05:47.039 || anyway those assets are now breaking not
00:05:48.409 || 00:05:48.419 || just the stock market but the bond
00:05:49.490 || 00:05:49.500 || markets
00:05:51.409 || 00:05:51.419 || even the US Government Bond Market is
00:05:52.490 || 00:05:52.500 || imploded
00:05:55.129 || 00:05:55.139 || has been imploding in fact it started
00:05:57.710 || 00:05:57.720 || before the stock market did uh so
00:05:58.790 || 00:05:58.800 || they're going to have to at some point
00:06:01.969 || 00:06:01.979 || come in and defend these quote essential
00:06:03.890 || 00:06:03.900 || assets
00:06:05.870 || 00:06:05.880 || the problem is that historically if you
00:06:08.570 || 00:06:08.580 || go back and look at the broken bubbles I
00:06:10.790 || 00:06:10.800 || named several of them
00:06:12.170 || 00:06:12.180 || the FED did come in for instance
00:06:15.890 || 00:06:15.900 || Bernanke pivoted in 2008 and tried to
00:06:17.450 || 00:06:17.460 || defend the stock market the real estate
00:06:18.710 || 00:06:18.720 || Arena
00:06:20.930 || 00:06:20.940 || they bought Community mortgage-backed
00:06:22.850 || 00:06:22.860 || Securities you know that didn't work
00:06:24.830 || 00:06:24.840 || because they monopolized the market and
00:06:26.689 || 00:06:26.699 || turned it into a non-market and
00:06:28.370 || 00:06:28.380 || ultimately the pricing was totally
00:06:31.129 || 00:06:31.139 || disfigured and chaotic
00:06:32.570 || 00:06:32.580 || so they helped implode that market
00:06:35.029 || 00:06:35.039 || instead of helping it but they tried to
00:06:38.689 || 00:06:38.699 || stop the decline and it didn't work
00:06:40.670 || 00:06:40.680 || why because the market ultimately
00:06:43.490 || 00:06:43.500 || reaches a point at which if it's created
00:06:46.550 || 00:06:46.560 || excess if it's created error in pricing
00:06:49.010 || 00:06:49.020 || if those errors have impacted
00:06:51.529 || 00:06:51.539 || individuals corporations municipal
00:06:52.969 || 00:06:52.979 || government state governments Federal
00:06:56.510 || 00:06:56.520 || governments in terms of their pricing
00:06:59.150 || 00:06:59.160 || their expectations their spending plans
00:07:02.689 || 00:07:02.699 || then those errors get puked out
00:07:06.050 || 00:07:06.060 || and you can't stop it it's made Nature's
00:07:07.969 || 00:07:07.979 || Way of correcting error
00:07:09.770 || 00:07:09.780 || and the FED created it but they
00:07:13.249 || 00:07:13.259 || inevitably cannot stop it oh finally the
00:07:14.870 || 00:07:14.880 || bubbles quit breaking but they usually
00:07:17.029 || 00:07:17.039 || collapse fully so
00:07:18.950 || 00:07:18.960 || that's what we expect this time except
00:07:20.510 || 00:07:20.520 || this time we note that it is the biggest
00:07:22.430 || 00:07:22.440 || bubble in U.S stock market or paper
00:07:27.230 || 00:07:27.240 || asset history so don't expect the normal
00:07:29.870 || 00:07:29.880 || gold knows that gold knows that
00:07:31.969 || 00:07:31.979 || ultimately central banks will have to
00:07:34.249 || 00:07:34.259 || Pivot back to what they do best
00:07:36.890 || 00:07:36.900 || which is print print because they have
00:07:39.589 || 00:07:39.599 || to defend their government bonds and I
00:07:41.629 || 00:07:41.639 || think that's what gold knows and
00:07:43.610 || 00:07:43.620 || therefore it's not waiting for Powell to
00:07:47.089 || 00:07:47.099 || state that it knows it's going to come
00:07:49.249 || 00:07:49.259 || and we'll see data flows that finally
00:07:50.270 || 00:07:50.280 || will
00:07:51.830 || 00:07:51.840 || enhance that
00:07:53.629 || 00:07:53.639 || anyway that I think is the major event
00:07:56.450 || 00:07:56.460 || of the year is that that shift in asset
00:07:57.710 || 00:07:57.720 || pricing
00:08:00.350 || 00:08:00.360 || has been subtle but favoring gold and
00:08:01.070 || 00:08:01.080 || silver
00:08:03.290 || 00:08:03.300 || it's definitely something that you
00:08:05.270 || 00:08:05.280 || mentioned that it's subtle because you
00:08:07.730 || 00:08:07.740 || know gold really hasn't it it's moved up
00:08:09.950 || 00:08:09.960 || and down it's pretty much the same as
00:08:11.689 || 00:08:11.699 || where we started at the beginning of the
00:08:13.610 || 00:08:13.620 || year but the fact that it didn't fall I
00:08:14.930 || 00:08:14.940 || think is very significant as you
00:08:16.370 || 00:08:16.380 || mentioned because you know pretty much
00:08:19.309 || 00:08:19.319 || all other asset classes fell uh we have
00:08:21.469 || 00:08:21.479 || seen in the last few months uh just last
00:08:23.689 || 00:08:23.699 || couple months a huge rally in both the
00:08:26.150 || 00:08:26.160 || gold and especially silver here
00:08:28.189 || 00:08:28.199 || um do you see that it's a bit overbought
00:08:31.189 || 00:08:31.199 || right now or are we headed higher uh
00:08:32.930 || 00:08:32.940 || into next year from here
00:08:35.389 || 00:08:35.399 || there's always potential for short-term
00:08:37.790 || 00:08:37.800 || counter Trend moves we think the trend
00:08:39.350 || 00:08:39.360 || is shifted back favor and gold and
00:08:41.449 || 00:08:41.459 || silver we have a few we don't just come
00:08:43.190 || 00:08:43.200 || out with MSA doesn't just come out with
00:08:45.650 || 00:08:45.660 || one number that says Okay you cost this
00:08:47.630 || 00:08:47.640 || it's such the bear Market's over you're
00:08:49.490 || 00:08:49.500 || going up there were multiple numbers
00:08:52.370 || 00:08:52.380 || that gold just emerged above based on
00:08:54.230 || 00:08:54.240 || momentum structures breaking out forget
00:08:57.410 || 00:08:57.420 || the price charts same with silver we
00:08:59.269 || 00:08:59.279 || called most of these turns in September
00:09:01.190 || 00:09:01.200 || in October you can go back and look
00:09:03.230 || 00:09:03.240 || where they were at that time much below
00:09:06.230 || 00:09:06.240 || here there's still One More Level left
00:09:08.090 || 00:09:08.100 || in silver and one more level left in
00:09:09.889 || 00:09:09.899 || Gold it's above the market
00:09:12.470 || 00:09:12.480 || but it occurs well before we ever get
00:09:15.350 || 00:09:15.360 || back to the very obvious highs we've
00:09:17.269 || 00:09:17.279 || made now in in the case of gold we have
00:09:18.530 || 00:09:18.540 || two peaks
00:09:19.850 || 00:09:19.860 || and by the way in the history of gold
00:09:22.070 || 00:09:22.080 || it's never double topped so if you think
00:09:23.810 || 00:09:23.820 || you get a double top it's never done
00:09:25.370 || 00:09:25.380 || that it's always peaked and never come
00:09:27.530 || 00:09:27.540 || back to its high when it generates a
00:09:30.110 || 00:09:30.120 || bear Market this time we went back up to
00:09:31.850 || 00:09:31.860 || 2070 again
00:09:33.769 || 00:09:33.779 || did it March this year when it was we
00:09:35.449 || 00:09:35.459 || went back up to the high of the summer
00:09:40.910 || 00:09:40.920 || of 2020 which was also 2070 2070 dollars
00:09:42.230 || 00:09:42.240 || silver
00:09:44.389 || 00:09:44.399 || has two peaks up there around thirty
00:09:45.290 || 00:09:45.300 || dollars
00:09:46.910 || 00:09:46.920 || so if you look at the price chart you'd
00:09:48.530 || 00:09:48.540 || say well if silver gets back up to 30
00:09:50.449 || 00:09:50.459 || and goes through that's a Breakout
00:09:53.269 || 00:09:53.279 || if gold gets back up to 2070 and breaks
00:09:54.829 || 00:09:54.839 || above it that's a breakout well yeah
00:09:57.110 || 00:09:57.120 || that's true but it's a price chart
00:09:58.790 || 00:09:58.800 || our moment we have momentum numbers
00:10:01.250 || 00:10:01.260 || momentum based structures that will
00:10:03.170 || 00:10:03.180 || break out
00:10:05.269 || 00:10:05.279 || well before we get back to those numbers
00:10:07.670 || 00:10:07.680 || and these are our final Buy Signal
00:10:09.949 || 00:10:09.959 || numbers that we'll issue in our reports
00:10:12.410 || 00:10:12.420 || right now we're basically bullish with
00:10:14.449 || 00:10:14.459 || one more tier to break through
00:10:16.430 || 00:10:16.440 || and we think when that level gets broken
00:10:18.110 || 00:10:18.120 || through on gold and silver you'll see a
00:10:19.430 || 00:10:19.440 || gusher begin
00:10:22.250 || 00:10:22.260 || meaning no longer attempt in advance but
00:10:24.470 || 00:10:24.480 || something very dramatic a tonal change
00:10:27.650 || 00:10:27.660 || in both markets but your question was is
00:10:30.110 || 00:10:30.120 || there potential for pullback yes
00:10:33.590 || 00:10:33.600 || uh we see potential sometime in this
00:10:35.269 || 00:10:35.279 || quarter maybe to have silver drop back
00:10:37.430 || 00:10:37.440 || down in the lower 23s again which is to
00:10:39.170 || 00:10:39.180 || say drop three percent from where it is
00:10:40.070 || 00:10:40.080 || right now
00:10:42.110 || 00:10:42.120 || we see the potential for gold to maybe
00:10:43.730 || 00:10:43.740 || drop a couple percent from where it is
00:10:45.050 || 00:10:45.060 || right now
00:10:47.870 || 00:10:47.880 || but that's about it
00:10:50.690 || 00:10:50.700 || um so we do see the potential always for
00:10:53.030 || 00:10:53.040 || counter Trend moves but you we think you
00:10:55.730 || 00:10:55.740 || should basically ignore those if you're
00:10:57.050 || 00:10:57.060 || an investor
00:10:58.490 || 00:10:58.500 || you should be looking at the larger
00:10:59.630 || 00:10:59.640 || context
00:11:01.790 || 00:11:01.800 || and as far as we're concerned if one's
00:11:03.829 || 00:11:03.839 || in those markets you should be in now
00:11:06.710 || 00:11:06.720 || okay and there's one more tier that
00:11:08.150 || 00:11:08.160 || we've got to break through once we break
00:11:09.889 || 00:11:09.899 || through that we think that's it that's
00:11:12.410 || 00:11:12.420 || the final green light and we'll that
00:11:15.230 || 00:11:15.240 || will be in our reports
00:11:17.150 || 00:11:17.160 || I think it might be a bit difficult
00:11:18.710 || 00:11:18.720 || right now if we're you know looking at
00:11:21.710 || 00:11:21.720 || Silver at 24 and gold at 1800 and just a
00:11:24.170 || 00:11:24.180 || few months ago it was 16 something and
00:11:27.230 || 00:11:27.240 || the silver uh was 17 18. it might be
00:11:29.269 || 00:11:29.279 || hard for our viewers to think well you
00:11:30.949 || 00:11:30.959 || know Now's the Time to buy but it sounds
00:11:32.210 || 00:11:32.220 || like
00:11:34.009 || 00:11:34.019 || um what you're saying is the trend has
00:11:35.990 || 00:11:36.000 || started we might see a bit of a dip but
00:11:38.930 || 00:11:38.940 || really it in your perspective it's up up
00:11:40.190 || 00:11:40.200 || from here
00:11:43.009 || 00:11:43.019 || yeah with one more breakout level we had
00:11:44.870 || 00:11:44.880 || like three or four tiers that we broke
00:11:46.490 || 00:11:46.500 || through and you know like considered
00:11:49.790 || 00:11:49.800 || starting Gates no one holy number
00:11:51.949 || 00:11:51.959 || but you know levels on different time
00:11:53.870 || 00:11:53.880 || scales of our Trend assessment that
00:11:55.550 || 00:11:55.560 || broke through and these are back at
00:11:57.230 || 00:11:57.240 || levels well below here you know like in
00:11:58.190 || 00:11:58.200 || the
00:12:02.990 || 00:12:03.000 || 18 19 area in silver and upper 1600s in
00:12:04.730 || 00:12:04.740 || gold for example he had some major
00:12:07.009 || 00:12:07.019 || breakouts so no we're not saying buy it
00:12:09.170 || 00:12:09.180 || here we said buy it below here but on
00:12:10.550 || 00:12:10.560 || the other hand if you're not long you
00:12:12.350 || 00:12:12.360 || better consider it because uh there's
00:12:14.030 || 00:12:14.040 || only one more Starting Gate left and
00:12:16.069 || 00:12:16.079 || when we break through that one we think
00:12:18.110 || 00:12:18.120 || the tonal change in the markets will be
00:12:20.930 || 00:12:20.940 || surprising and people will have to chase
00:12:22.970 || 00:12:22.980 || it at that point
00:12:23.870 || 00:12:23.880 || um
00:12:26.030 || 00:12:26.040 || and we think it could be very dramatic
00:12:28.430 || 00:12:28.440 || and we we see the fundamentals for it as
00:12:30.110 || 00:12:30.120 || well because we think the FED has broken
00:12:32.329 || 00:12:32.339 || the biggest asset bubble in U.S stock
00:12:34.730 || 00:12:34.740 || market history and the consequences of
00:12:36.650 || 00:12:36.660 || that will cause Panic on the part of
00:12:38.690 || 00:12:38.700 || central banks not just the Fed
00:12:41.269 || 00:12:41.279 || and I know forgive me if I'm wrong but I
00:12:43.129 || 00:12:43.139 || believe this year you started looking at
00:12:44.990 || 00:12:45.000 || the US dollar Index
00:12:47.449 || 00:12:47.459 || um can you give us an update on that why
00:12:49.190 || 00:12:49.200 || why you started looking at that again
00:12:50.990 || 00:12:51.000 || and I know one of the things that you
00:12:52.310 || 00:12:52.320 || said in a previous interview was you
00:12:54.290 || 00:12:54.300 || were looking for a waterfall decline in
00:12:55.970 || 00:12:55.980 || it we have seen quite a bit of a decline
00:12:57.949 || 00:12:57.959 || in the dollar Index but do you see it
00:12:59.629 || 00:12:59.639 || declining further from here
00:13:02.030 || 00:13:02.040 || yeah there's a
00:13:04.670 || 00:13:04.680 || the dollar Index compared to gold
00:13:07.670 || 00:13:07.680 || is not a good inverse relationship if
00:13:10.310 || 00:13:10.320 || you go back 50 years and overlay a chart
00:13:12.470 || 00:13:12.480 || monthly bar chart of the dollar index in
00:13:13.970 || 00:13:13.980 || Gold you'll find there's periods of time
00:13:16.370 || 00:13:16.380 || including multiple years where basically
00:13:18.710 || 00:13:18.720 || they both went up together down together
00:13:20.509 || 00:13:20.519 || you know not not dramatically but you
00:13:22.610 || 00:13:22.620 || know in in similar sinks so they really
00:13:24.170 || 00:13:24.180 || weren't good inverse now there are
00:13:26.690 || 00:13:26.700 || periods of time where there is a closer
00:13:28.670 || 00:13:28.680 || inverse relationship and we've seen that
00:13:29.629 || 00:13:29.639 || this year
00:13:31.490 || 00:13:31.500 || especially starting around March when
00:13:34.150 || 00:13:34.160 || gold made its high it
00:13:36.889 || 00:13:36.899 || 2078 I think was the price it was in
00:13:39.470 || 00:13:39.480 || March that's when the dollar emerged up
00:13:42.110 || 00:13:42.120 || through some momentum structures that we
00:13:42.829 || 00:13:42.839 || had
00:13:45.650 || 00:13:45.660 || not not very long term but enough to you
00:13:47.629 || 00:13:47.639 || know cause or cause the rally
00:13:49.850 || 00:13:49.860 || and also if you look at a dollar index
00:13:53.629 || 00:13:53.639 || price chart go back to 2015
00:13:55.610 || 00:13:55.620 || there was a bull market there that ended
00:13:58.550 || 00:13:58.560 || we called in 2012 that we went from like
00:14:00.530 || 00:14:00.540 || 70 on the dollar Index to 100 and at
00:14:02.509 || 00:14:02.519 || that point we went neutral dollar Index
00:14:04.550 || 00:14:04.560 || started to go sideways
00:14:09.290 || 00:14:09.300 || and actually from December of 2015 the
00:14:12.290 || 00:14:12.300 || dollar Index was at 96
00:14:14.870 || 00:14:14.880 || or 98 something
00:14:19.190 || 00:14:19.200 || and gold was down at 1050.
00:14:21.470 || 00:14:21.480 || gold doubled in price
00:14:24.949 || 00:14:24.959 || from its December 2015 low to its summer
00:14:28.670 || 00:14:28.680 || 2020 high and yet the dollar Index was
00:14:30.710 || 00:14:30.720 || in a sideways range so again the
00:14:32.930 || 00:14:32.940 || correlation was not very good you didn't
00:14:34.790 || 00:14:34.800 || have a weak dollar and yet gold doubled
00:14:37.190 || 00:14:37.200 || but since March of this year they have
00:14:39.290 || 00:14:39.300 || been in in very strong inverse
00:14:41.810 || 00:14:41.820 || relationship
00:14:44.030 || 00:14:44.040 || the dollar Index reached near 115
00:14:46.310 || 00:14:46.320 || several months back
00:14:49.550 || 00:14:49.560 || when it dropped back down under 111 we
00:14:52.069 || 00:14:52.079 || had momentum Trend breakage not price
00:14:53.990 || 00:14:54.000 || breakage but momentum Trend said that's
00:14:55.670 || 00:14:55.680 || it that was probably the top you're
00:14:57.470 || 00:14:57.480 || going down and we thought it would go
00:15:00.530 || 00:15:00.540 || down to about 103 and a half area
00:15:02.629 || 00:15:02.639 || there are certain reasons for that
00:15:05.569 || 00:15:05.579 || one of the obvious reasons for that is
00:15:07.490 || 00:15:07.500 || price based which we don't particularly
00:15:10.490 || 00:15:10.500 || like but most people do okay meaning
00:15:12.290 || 00:15:12.300 || there were two price highs in the dollar
00:15:15.290 || 00:15:15.300 || Index one was in 2017.
00:15:19.129 || 00:15:19.139 || at 103 plus one above 103 and a half but
00:15:22.550 || 00:15:22.560 || not up to 104 okay then in March of 2020
00:15:24.470 || 00:15:24.480 || during the stock market Panic if we
00:15:26.750 || 00:15:26.760 || recall the dollar surged again
00:15:28.850 || 00:15:28.860 || and it reached up to 103 and a half but
00:15:31.129 || 00:15:31.139 || not 104. so there's a little window in
00:15:33.650 || 00:15:33.660 || there where it peaked two times so it's
00:15:35.990 || 00:15:36.000 || only natural that when you drop from a
00:15:38.930 || 00:15:38.940 || Marcel level just below 111. we thought
00:15:41.090 || 00:15:41.100 || you might find support around 103 and a
00:15:42.829 || 00:15:42.839 || half and sure enough it's found support
00:15:45.650 || 00:15:45.660 || there because anybody with a ruler and a
00:15:47.569 || 00:15:47.579 || crayon can draw a line across those two
00:15:49.730 || 00:15:49.740 || price chart highs and say gee this must
00:15:50.990 || 00:15:51.000 || be support
00:15:53.329 || 00:15:53.339 || what's interesting is that they've been
00:15:54.829 || 00:15:54.839 || buying it there
00:15:56.750 || 00:15:56.760 || between one or three and a half and 104
00:15:59.210 || 00:15:59.220 || for the last three weeks and they're not
00:16:01.430 || 00:16:01.440 || making any money
00:16:03.530 || 00:16:03.540 || yeah they're buying support but so far
00:16:05.150 || 00:16:05.160 || the guys who are buying it there with
00:16:07.610 || 00:16:07.620 || the just bleeding obvious level aren't
00:16:09.710 || 00:16:09.720 || making money so it wouldn't shock us
00:16:11.990 || 00:16:12.000 || that we stopped them out I mean and you
00:16:13.730 || 00:16:13.740 || plunge the dollar a bit more
00:16:15.829 || 00:16:15.839 || and then maybe you can get a rally in
00:16:17.150 || 00:16:17.160 || the dollar
00:16:20.090 || 00:16:20.100 || not the 105 maybe 106 or something
00:16:22.009 || 00:16:22.019 || it's counter Trend rally don't be don't
00:16:24.410 || 00:16:24.420 || be confused by it and that might also be
00:16:25.970 || 00:16:25.980 || coincident with some kind of pullback in
00:16:28.189 || 00:16:28.199 || Gold but again it's counter Trend it is
00:16:29.569 || 00:16:29.579 || not to be
00:16:31.910 || 00:16:31.920 || heated as something significant
00:16:34.910 || 00:16:34.920 || the dollar we think is broken
00:16:36.889 || 00:16:36.899 || we think it'll be more broken once the
00:16:38.509 || 00:16:38.519 || price guys realize that they're double
00:16:41.090 || 00:16:41.100 || tops at 103 and a half area don't hold
00:16:43.370 || 00:16:43.380 || that's when they're gonna start pulling
00:16:44.870 || 00:16:44.880 || their hair out saying my goodness you
00:16:47.329 || 00:16:47.339 || know what's going on here uh and we
00:16:48.710 || 00:16:48.720 || think the dollar then will enter a
00:16:50.210 || 00:16:50.220 || downside trajectory with more
00:16:51.769 || 00:16:51.779 || significance
00:16:54.050 || 00:16:54.060 || now when it comes to this shift that
00:16:56.090 || 00:16:56.100 || we're seeing and we've seen this year
00:17:00.650 || 00:17:00.660 || with gold not falling uh you're for the
00:17:02.150 || 00:17:02.160 || whole you know the whole year it's
00:17:04.250 || 00:17:04.260 || pretty much even but the stock market
00:17:05.630 || 00:17:05.640 || falling and we're seeing so we're seeing
00:17:07.429 || 00:17:07.439 || in renewed interest in precious metals
00:17:10.270 || 00:17:10.280 || and movement out of the stock market
00:17:12.770 || 00:17:12.780 || who is doing this do you think what are
00:17:14.449 || 00:17:14.459 || the players I know there's been a lot of
00:17:16.669 || 00:17:16.679 || accumulation by central banks
00:17:18.590 || 00:17:18.600 || um do you see that those being the main
00:17:20.210 || 00:17:20.220 || players do you see just individual
00:17:21.710 || 00:17:21.720 || investors
00:17:23.809 || 00:17:23.819 || um who are the big players uh in this
00:17:25.970 || 00:17:25.980 || market right now I won't specifically
00:17:28.210 || 00:17:28.220 || name funds but there's some big name
00:17:31.669 || 00:17:31.679 || hedge fund and and asset managers out
00:17:34.370 || 00:17:34.380 || there who you see on CNBC who for many
00:17:37.070 || 00:17:37.080 || months said hey this stock market thing
00:17:39.110 || 00:17:39.120 || is not good and they've started to move
00:17:41.510 || 00:17:41.520 || money out of that perceiving it to be
00:17:50.990 || 00:17:51.000 || than the stock market even
00:17:52.669 || 00:17:52.679 || um so they they didn't go into paper
00:17:54.650 || 00:17:54.660 || assets but they clearly moved into gold
00:17:55.990 || 00:17:56.000 || and some of them have stated this
00:17:58.250 || 00:17:58.260 || outright that you know they they favor
00:18:01.730 || 00:18:01.740 || gold because they see what I said uh is
00:18:04.010 || 00:18:04.020 || a likely outcome that the central banks
00:18:06.529 || 00:18:06.539 || will have to again reverse due to
00:18:08.570 || 00:18:08.580 || reality back to what they're they're
00:18:10.490 || 00:18:10.500 || intended to do namely
00:18:12.950 || 00:18:12.960 || by their government bonds when their
00:18:15.770 || 00:18:15.780 || government bonds become under stress uh
00:18:19.010 || 00:18:19.020 || and even uh our secretary treasury has
00:18:22.070 || 00:18:22.080 || declared a few months ago that uh the
00:18:23.930 || 00:18:23.940 || U.S government Bond Market has become
00:18:25.130 || 00:18:25.140 || illiquid
00:18:28.010 || 00:18:28.020 || oh that's the worst word you can use in
00:18:29.630 || 00:18:29.640 || the market not that it's going down but
00:18:31.370 || 00:18:31.380 || it's illiquid when something becomes
00:18:33.890 || 00:18:33.900 || illiquid it's highly dangerous and to
00:18:35.510 || 00:18:35.520 || say that the US Government Bond Market
00:18:38.029 || 00:18:38.039 || has become illiquid it's probably the
00:18:40.010 || 00:18:40.020 || most dangerous statement she could have
00:18:42.409 || 00:18:42.419 || made and and but she was fair when she
00:18:44.330 || 00:18:44.340 || made it and I think that is the key
00:18:46.789 || 00:18:46.799 || issue because if that situation and the
00:18:49.430 || 00:18:49.440 || paper asset implosion continues which we
00:18:51.010 || 00:18:51.020 || think it will
00:18:54.470 || 00:18:54.480 || then they're going to have to reverse
00:18:55.909 || 00:18:55.919 || now I don't know how they're going to do
00:18:57.409 || 00:18:57.419 || it intellectually
00:18:59.270 || 00:18:59.280 || you know without admitting oh gosh we
00:19:00.650 || 00:19:00.660 || were wrong again
00:19:02.090 || 00:19:02.100 || but I suspect they're going to lose
00:19:04.070 || 00:19:04.080 || credibility over time
00:19:05.210 || 00:19:05.220 || among
00:19:07.190 || 00:19:07.200 || outside economists many of whom were
00:19:09.590 || 00:19:09.600 || pro-fed people who've now said oh the
00:19:11.270 || 00:19:11.280 || fed's gone down the wrong course gone
00:19:13.130 || 00:19:13.140 || too far
00:19:14.390 || 00:19:14.400 || um
00:19:16.430 || 00:19:16.440 || and suddenly the FED will no longer have
00:19:18.350 || 00:19:18.360 || the respect that it's had which it
00:19:20.270 || 00:19:20.280 || shouldn't have had in the first place
00:19:22.130 || 00:19:22.140 || because generally it creates the boom
00:19:24.409 || 00:19:24.419 || bust Cycles it's not the
00:19:26.270 || 00:19:26.280 || Shepherd that keeps them orderly it's
00:19:28.210 || 00:19:28.220 || the one who creates the situations
00:19:30.590 || 00:19:30.600 || and I think that's
00:19:32.630 || 00:19:32.640 || that's the situation we face and I think
00:19:34.310 || 00:19:34.320 || some large asset managers not just
00:19:35.810 || 00:19:35.820 || central banks around the world as you've
00:19:37.730 || 00:19:37.740 || noted have acquired gold but I think
00:19:39.350 || 00:19:39.360 || it's some large asset managers who've
00:19:41.450 || 00:19:41.460 || made shifts into that Arena
00:19:43.730 || 00:19:43.740 || because they perceive it to be either
00:19:45.650 || 00:19:45.660 || one by positive the situation or
00:19:47.750 || 00:19:47.760 || certainly a less risky situation you
00:19:49.130 || 00:19:49.140 || mentioned central banks are losing
00:19:51.470 || 00:19:51.480 || credibility right now we are seeing the
00:19:54.529 || 00:19:54.539 || FED uh reduce the rate of increase what
00:19:57.350 || 00:19:57.360 || do you see for them coming in 2023 do
00:19:59.090 || 00:19:59.100 || you think that'll be the year that they
00:20:01.610 || 00:20:01.620 || actually pivot and reverse course back
00:20:03.590 || 00:20:03.600 || to easing I think they'll have to
00:20:05.450 || 00:20:05.460 || because I don't
00:20:07.970 || 00:20:07.980 || I don't see the trend events in the
00:20:13.250 || 00:20:13.260 || market uh the NASDAQ 100 the S P 500 we
00:20:15.169 || 00:20:15.179 || also watched The Big Three stocks Apple
00:20:17.270 || 00:20:17.280 || Amazon and Microsoft Is Our Big Three
00:20:20.029 || 00:20:20.039 || and you got to realize NASDAQ 100 it
00:20:22.010 || 00:20:22.020 || went up 16-fold but the s p went up
00:20:24.650 || 00:20:24.660 || Sevenfold So you talk about a bubble
00:20:28.549 || 00:20:28.559 || okay uh it doesn't compare to.com
00:20:30.890 || 00:20:30.900 || uh so and and our measurement of the
00:20:32.990 || 00:20:33.000 || breakage that has already occurred is
00:20:35.409 || 00:20:35.419 || you're nowhere near
00:20:38.570 || 00:20:38.580 || levels that would justify starting to
00:20:39.770 || 00:20:39.780 || even talk about
00:20:41.870 || 00:20:41.880 || possible basing action
00:20:44.450 || 00:20:44.460 || anything you see on price that appears
00:20:46.310 || 00:20:46.320 || to be attempt to hold
00:20:50.029 || 00:20:50.039 || is merely an attempt to hold there were
00:20:52.250 || 00:20:52.260 || several of these patterns back in 2008
00:20:54.590 || 00:20:54.600 || by the way on the way down after we
00:20:56.810 || 00:20:56.820 || topped in 2007 there was a Shard crop
00:20:59.570 || 00:20:59.580 || into early 2008 and it was a rally from
00:21:02.210 || 00:21:02.220 || the January March lows of 2008 back up
00:21:05.390 || 00:21:05.400 || to May it really was impressive
00:21:09.169 || 00:21:09.179 || to most most chart Watchers we didn't
00:21:10.669 || 00:21:10.679 || like it but it was it took you back
00:21:12.049 || 00:21:12.059 || unchanging on the year and then then
00:21:15.650 || 00:21:15.660 || came the onslaught later in 2008 and we
00:21:17.810 || 00:21:17.820 || think the one slot is about to begin
00:21:21.830 || 00:21:21.840 || in 2023 the 2022 was merely
00:21:24.230 || 00:21:24.240 || the beginning
00:21:26.390 || 00:21:26.400 || uh and that you know we still here on
00:21:28.250 || 00:21:28.260 || CNBC and Fox Business for example
00:21:31.010 || 00:21:31.020 || chatter about bottoming possible
00:21:32.450 || 00:21:32.460 || bottoming they're using the word bottom
00:21:33.890 || 00:21:33.900 || when they quit using the word bottom
00:21:36.350 || 00:21:36.360 || maybe start to pay attention but
00:21:37.669 || 00:21:37.679 || everybody's still chattering about
00:21:39.230 || 00:21:39.240 || whether this is the bottom or not a
00:21:40.970 || 00:21:40.980 || bottom well the fact that they're even
00:21:42.649 || 00:21:42.659 || discussing the issue means that they
00:21:44.810 || 00:21:44.820 || don't perceive the reality that we think
00:21:46.909 || 00:21:46.919 || is underway and we don't think the FED
00:21:49.730 || 00:21:49.740 || realizes it either uh they will they
00:21:52.850 || 00:21:52.860 || will realize it later in 2023 and I
00:21:54.950 || 00:21:54.960 || think at that point after the events
00:21:56.450 || 00:21:56.460 || occur in other words Gold's not going to
00:21:58.610 || 00:21:58.620 || wait for some announcement from Powell
00:22:00.590 || 00:22:00.600 || that says well you know we're going to
00:22:02.390 || 00:22:02.400 || stop raising rates for a while or you
00:22:03.830 || 00:22:03.840 || know he'll have to transition in some
00:22:05.149 || 00:22:05.159 || way
00:22:07.130 || 00:22:07.140 || gold will see the events that are
00:22:08.149 || 00:22:08.159 || occurring
00:22:11.210 || 00:22:11.220 || in key assets and no
00:22:13.370 || 00:22:13.380 || what the Central Bank response will have
00:22:14.210 || 00:22:14.220 || to be
00:22:16.370 || 00:22:16.380 || and we'll go ahead and move for the
00:22:18.350 || 00:22:18.360 || Central Bank even tells you
00:22:21.230 || 00:22:21.240 || uh gold is an anticipatory so you know
00:22:23.510 || 00:22:23.520 || it's been around thousands of years it's
00:22:25.070 || 00:22:25.080 || not like some new market that just you
00:22:26.930 || 00:22:26.940 || know came into being it's a Wise Market
00:22:29.390 || 00:22:29.400 || it's global
00:22:32.270 || 00:22:32.280 || uh and it's perhaps the wisest Market
00:22:33.830 || 00:22:33.840 || out there and maybe that's why it didn't
00:22:35.930 || 00:22:35.940 || go down this year
00:22:37.789 || 00:22:37.799 || because it knows what's coming
00:22:39.470 || 00:22:39.480 || yeah no I mean by the room or sell the
00:22:40.909 || 00:22:40.919 || news right gold doesn't move on
00:22:43.549 || 00:22:43.559 || headlines it anticipates me any last
00:22:45.649 || 00:22:45.659 || thoughts for 2023 what you're
00:22:47.270 || 00:22:47.280 || anticipating the risks out there that
00:22:49.789 || 00:22:49.799 || people should be considering right now
00:22:51.710 || 00:22:51.720 || in general the stock market we think has
00:22:53.990 || 00:22:54.000 || only begun its decline we think it'll be
00:22:57.770 || 00:22:57.780 || quite serious uh if I had to I I don't
00:22:59.630 || 00:22:59.640 || have any downside numbers frankly people
00:23:01.610 || 00:23:01.620 || have asked me that I don't have a Target
00:23:04.490 || 00:23:04.500 || except to say that this should be the
00:23:06.590 || 00:23:06.600 || worst bubble unraveling that we've ever
00:23:07.850 || 00:23:07.860 || seen in the U.S stock market history
00:23:10.730 || 00:23:10.740 || simply due to the age
00:23:13.029 || 00:23:13.039 || and the severity of the upside
00:23:15.289 || 00:23:15.299 || percentage-wise that when it comes
00:23:16.549 || 00:23:16.559 || undone
00:23:18.049 || 00:23:18.059 || and you know it's not like everything
00:23:21.350 || 00:23:21.360 || got better after 2009 in the sense of a
00:23:23.990 || 00:23:24.000 || reality got better monetary policy got
00:23:25.970 || 00:23:25.980 || so loose that we printed our way out of
00:23:28.070 || 00:23:28.080 || the hole and therefore the money had to
00:23:29.930 || 00:23:29.940 || flow somewhere they printed it it went
00:23:31.970 || 00:23:31.980 || somewhere asset managers put it into
00:23:35.090 || 00:23:35.100 || stocks and uh and as is usually the case
00:23:36.649 || 00:23:36.659 || they stayed too long
00:23:39.010 || 00:23:39.020 || if we had the excess
00:23:42.590 || 00:23:42.600 || but when that comes Unwound money will
00:23:45.409 || 00:23:45.419 || go somewhere it's already started to and
00:23:46.669 || 00:23:46.679 || I think you're going to see a dramatic
00:23:48.830 || 00:23:48.840 || move into gold and silver with silver it
00:23:51.830 || 00:23:51.840 || by far the leader as it's been actually
00:23:54.289 || 00:23:54.299 || since September uh late September it's
00:23:56.570 || 00:23:56.580 || shifted against gold favoring silver
00:23:59.090 || 00:23:59.100 || again and sure enough since then
00:24:00.950 || 00:24:00.960 || you've had that out performance by
00:24:02.690 || 00:24:02.700 || silver
00:24:04.909 || 00:24:04.919 || um so we think that's the main focus for
00:24:06.649 || 00:24:06.659 || next year on the long side as far as the
00:24:08.090 || 00:24:08.100 || short side basically you could throw a
00:24:09.770 || 00:24:09.780 || dart if it's a paper asset be careful
00:24:11.450 || 00:24:11.460 || all right well it'll definitely be
00:24:14.270 || 00:24:14.280 || interested it's interesting to see 2023
00:24:16.130 || 00:24:16.140 || and continue to track this with you
00:24:17.630 || 00:24:17.640 || Michael thank you so much for your time

00:24:28.310 || 00:24:28.320 || bit about momentum structural analysis
00:24:31.490 || 00:24:31.500 || we uh there was an article on us written
00:24:32.810 || 00:24:32.820 || by in the Wall Street Journal and
00:24:36.529 || 00:24:36.539 || Christmas issue of December 2015. it
00:24:38.690 || 00:24:38.700 || focused just on our method and they
00:24:40.850 || 00:24:40.860 || summed it up pretty well they said that
00:24:42.970 || 00:24:42.980 || we we tend to look at long-term
00:24:46.130 || 00:24:46.140 || technicals but not price charts we look
00:24:48.770 || 00:24:48.780 || at long-term momentum trends
00:24:50.810 || 00:24:50.820 || and we don't mean wet noodle type
00:24:52.549 || 00:24:52.559 || indicators but stuff that when you plot
00:24:53.870 || 00:24:53.880 || it's like it looks like a price chart
00:24:55.370 || 00:24:55.380 || where there's bars and you can draw
00:24:57.830 || 00:24:57.840 || lines and there's structures and quite
00:25:00.350 || 00:25:00.360 || often momentum in fact most of the time
00:25:02.630 || 00:25:02.640 || 90 plus percent of the time if there's a
00:25:05.570 || 00:25:05.580 || trend change to come whether a top or a
00:25:07.970 || 00:25:07.980 || bottom momentum will tell you before
00:25:09.529 || 00:25:09.539 || price does
00:25:11.390 || 00:25:11.400 || you'll see it coming
00:25:13.549 || 00:25:13.559 || uh much like when you see a price chart
00:25:15.470 || 00:25:15.480 || topping pattern everybody can recognize
00:25:17.029 || 00:25:17.039 || your head and shoulder top all that kind
00:25:19.010 || 00:25:19.020 || of you see that on momentum months
00:25:19.970 || 00:25:19.980 || before
00:25:22.370 || 00:25:22.380 || the price price action of the market
00:25:24.649 || 00:25:24.659 || says oh we're going down we're going up
00:25:27.590 || 00:25:27.600 || uh and so that's what we do is we focus
00:25:30.049 || 00:25:30.059 || on technicals but momentum technicals
00:25:31.430 || 00:25:31.440 || before price
00:25:33.590 || 00:25:33.600 || and we think that gives our subscribers
