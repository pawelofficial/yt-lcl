00:00:02.310 || 00:00:02.320 || risk assets have sold off over the last
00:00:05.910 || 00:00:05.920 || two weeks can this sell off stabilize or
00:00:08.150 || 00:00:08.160 || are we headed for another bear market

00:00:21.510 || 00:00:21.520 || always a pleasure to talk to you always
00:00:23.029 || 00:00:23.039 || a pleasure three weeks ago was last time
00:00:25.910 || 00:00:25.920 || we spoke and since then i'm just looking
00:00:28.790 || 00:00:28.800 || at the s p 500 chart it slid four
00:00:31.589 || 00:00:31.599 || percent since its highs from uh november
00:00:33.510 || 00:00:33.520 || the bitcoin chart is something we'll go
00:00:35.990 || 00:00:36.000 || over first that's obviously slid
00:00:38.069 || 00:00:38.079 || dramatically and we'll we'll clarify
00:00:39.510 || 00:00:39.520 || exactly what you meant i i have to share
00:00:41.350 || 00:00:41.360 || a funny story i was telling you offline
00:00:42.549 || 00:00:42.559 || i was walking down the street of
00:00:45.830 || 00:00:45.840 || montreal and uh some some man came up to
00:00:47.190 || 00:00:47.200 || me and said oh you i recognize you
00:00:48.709 || 00:00:48.719 || you're from kikko and the first thing he
00:00:51.029 || 00:00:51.039 || said was i remember your gary soloway
00:00:53.029 || 00:00:53.039 || interviews gareth solomon man that guy
00:00:55.110 || 00:00:55.120 || he's been calling 20 000 bitcoin for
00:00:57.590 || 00:00:57.600 || months i haven't seen it what's going on
00:00:58.790 || 00:00:58.800 || where's the twenty thousand dollar
00:01:00.790 || 00:01:00.800 || bitcoin i wanna buy it but i wanna buy
00:01:02.869 || 00:01:02.879 || it more so people are starting to ask me
00:01:04.789 || 00:01:04.799 || to clarify with you so let's let's set
00:01:06.710 || 00:01:06.720 || the record straight here um
00:01:08.390 || 00:01:08.400 || what did you when are we seeing twenty
00:01:10.789 || 00:01:10.799 || thousand dollar bitcoin um
00:01:12.469 || 00:01:12.479 || and uh if that guy on the streets were
00:01:13.109 || 00:01:13.119 || uh
00:01:14.469 || 00:01:14.479 || from the street where we're here right
00:01:16.550 || 00:01:16.560 || now he probably asked you gareth why
00:01:19.270 || 00:01:19.280 || haven't we dipped yet why can't i buy in
00:01:21.510 || 00:01:21.520 || yeah so so number one you are a true
00:01:23.510 || 00:01:23.520 || celebrity now no i wouldn't i wouldn't
00:01:25.270 || 00:01:25.280 || say that i think i i've been recognized
00:01:27.670 || 00:01:27.680 || through you that's what happened
00:01:29.510 || 00:01:29.520 || so so let's be clear all right so so
00:01:32.149 || 00:01:32.159 || when i talk 20 000 on bitcoin um you
00:01:33.670 || 00:01:33.680 || have to understand that i always said it
00:01:35.670 || 00:01:35.680 || had to come with a deleveraging event
00:01:37.350 || 00:01:37.360 || right so deleveraging where there's so
00:01:39.590 || 00:01:39.600 || much margin in the system so much money
00:01:41.429 || 00:01:41.439 || being borrowed to buy bitcoin to buy
00:01:43.510 || 00:01:43.520 || stocks and it's always been key to
00:01:45.429 || 00:01:45.439 || understand that it has to coincide with
00:01:47.270 || 00:01:47.280 || the stock market decline if you'll
00:01:48.710 || 00:01:48.720 || notice what we've seen lately right
00:01:50.789 || 00:01:50.799 || we've seen bitcoin collapsing here
00:01:52.789 || 00:01:52.799 || here's the chart of bitcoin coming down
00:01:55.030 || 00:01:55.040 || significantly from those highs and
00:01:56.469 || 00:01:56.479 || what's going on in the stock market
00:01:58.389 || 00:01:58.399 || you're starting to see panic and
00:02:00.469 || 00:02:00.479 || deleveraging so this is the type of
00:02:02.310 || 00:02:02.320 || environment that you could see a move
00:02:04.630 || 00:02:04.640 || down to 20 000 but please understand
00:02:05.990 || 00:02:06.000 || that you have to see the full d
00:02:08.550 || 00:02:08.560 || leveraging in the stock market occur
00:02:09.990 || 00:02:10.000 || right now what has occurred in the stock
00:02:12.150 || 00:02:12.160 || market is not the fully leveraging it's
00:02:15.430 || 00:02:15.440 || like a two percent amount of it so again
00:02:16.949 || 00:02:16.959 || that's very important it's got to
00:02:18.869 || 00:02:18.879 || coincide with it i still personally
00:02:20.869 || 00:02:20.879 || believe it will happen david you know
00:02:23.030 || 00:02:23.040 || when we were in dubai i talked about how
00:02:24.550 || 00:02:24.560 || the market in bitcoin looked like a
00:02:26.470 || 00:02:26.480 || double top to me everyone was screaming
00:02:28.070 || 00:02:28.080 || it was going to go to a hundred thousand
00:02:29.670 || 00:02:29.680 || i said i don't trust it it's still
00:02:31.589 || 00:02:31.599 || technically on a four year cycle and
00:02:34.710 || 00:02:34.720 || here we are from 68 000 down to about 48
00:02:36.710 || 00:02:36.720 || to 49 000.
00:02:38.470 || 00:02:38.480 || something i've learned from speaking to
00:02:40.790 || 00:02:40.800 || uh people in the crypto space is that
00:02:43.509 || 00:02:43.519 || bitcoin typically is driven by sentiment
00:02:45.270 || 00:02:45.280 || more than technological innovations and
00:02:47.190 || 00:02:47.200 || so we've seen the tap upgrade come out a
00:02:49.750 || 00:02:49.760 || few years starting a few a few weeks ago
00:02:52.470 || 00:02:52.480 || and that did nothing to boost the price
00:02:53.990 || 00:02:54.000 || we've seen um
00:02:56.630 || 00:02:56.640 || continuous developments in the d5 space
00:02:58.710 || 00:02:58.720 || layer two protocols being added doing
00:03:01.509 || 00:03:01.519 || nothing to breach new all-time highs so
00:03:03.190 || 00:03:03.200 || what's the sentiment right now on
00:03:04.790 || 00:03:04.800 || bitcoin because that that seems to be
00:03:06.949 || 00:03:06.959 || the core driver of of bitcoin not
00:03:08.550 || 00:03:08.560 || cryptos at large but just bitcoin is
00:03:09.910 || 00:03:09.920 || sentiment
00:03:12.229 || 00:03:12.239 || yeah so you're you're 100 right and i
00:03:14.710 || 00:03:14.720 || still remember being in dubai the etf
00:03:16.470 || 00:03:16.480 || was just launching there was so much
00:03:18.630 || 00:03:18.640 || hype if you went on social media all you
00:03:21.030 || 00:03:21.040 || heard about was the crazy you know moves
00:03:22.869 || 00:03:22.879 || in bitcoin how it was going to go so so
00:03:24.710 || 00:03:24.720 || high so quickly and to be honest that
00:03:25.990 || 00:03:26.000 || was one of the things that i kind of
00:03:27.910 || 00:03:27.920 || coined off of to be a little bit more on
00:03:29.830 || 00:03:29.840 || the cautious side and one of the things
00:03:31.190 || 00:03:31.200 || i point out if you look at the bitcoin
00:03:32.789 || 00:03:32.799 || chart here here was your april high
00:03:34.949 || 00:03:34.959 || right and if you draw a trend line over
00:03:37.110 || 00:03:37.120 || notice how you pierce it on two separate
00:03:39.509 || 00:03:39.519 || occasions here and here and each time it
00:03:41.990 || 00:03:42.000 || got sold into if there's that much
00:03:44.229 || 00:03:44.239 || bullish sentiment in the average
00:03:45.350 || 00:03:45.360 || investor
00:03:46.949 || 00:03:46.959 || why didn't it surge higher and the
00:03:48.309 || 00:03:48.319 || answer is it didn't search higher
00:03:49.750 || 00:03:49.760 || because there were bigger players
00:03:51.509 || 00:03:51.519 || unloading there and you have to pay
00:03:53.509 || 00:03:53.519 || attention to this stuff so yes it made a
00:03:56.070 || 00:03:56.080 || higher high here and here but also you
00:03:57.910 || 00:03:57.920 || have to recognize that it failed it
00:03:59.990 || 00:04:00.000 || failed any sort of breakout and again
00:04:01.910 || 00:04:01.920 || you've come down significantly so you're
00:04:03.830 || 00:04:03.840 || right you know fear and greed rule the
00:04:05.750 || 00:04:05.760 || markets in the short term uh people have
00:04:07.030 || 00:04:07.040 || always said you know why don't you look
00:04:09.030 || 00:04:09.040 || at on-chain analysis you know that's so
00:04:11.110 || 00:04:11.120 || important for bitcoin and crypto and the
00:04:12.949 || 00:04:12.959 || answer is in the short term i'm a swing
00:04:14.789 || 00:04:14.799 || trader in the short term that doesn't
00:04:16.870 || 00:04:16.880 || matter the only thing that matters is
00:04:18.550 || 00:04:18.560 || greed and fear and what we've seen
00:04:20.629 || 00:04:20.639 || lately is fear starting to swoop in
00:04:22.230 || 00:04:22.240 || that's going to be the predominant force
00:04:24.550 || 00:04:24.560 || in bitcoin until it flips is that
00:04:26.469 || 00:04:26.479 || sentiment stabilizing are we seeing
00:04:29.189 || 00:04:29.199 || slightly less fear now as of monday
00:04:31.670 || 00:04:31.680 || morning than maybe a week ago gareth
00:04:33.430 || 00:04:33.440 || yeah absolutely so i got to show you
00:04:35.110 || 00:04:35.120 || guys this stuff here so some cool stuff
00:04:37.030 || 00:04:37.040 || so number one i'm a swing trader and i
00:04:38.150 || 00:04:38.160 || want to make that clear before i say
00:04:39.590 || 00:04:39.600 || this statement because this doesn't mean
00:04:41.350 || 00:04:41.360 || i'm a long-term investor yet and being
00:04:44.550 || 00:04:44.560 || bitcoin but i did buy bitcoin all right
00:04:48.070 || 00:04:48.080 || just right around 48 500. the reason i
00:04:50.550 || 00:04:50.560 || did it is there's a key trend line here
00:04:52.469 || 00:04:52.479 || all right look at this that we hit right
00:04:54.150 || 00:04:54.160 || so you have a beautiful trend line there
00:04:56.070 || 00:04:56.080 || notice the pierce right there and you
00:04:57.909 || 00:04:57.919 || also have some other factors on the
00:05:00.310 || 00:05:00.320 || bitcoin chart that gave it extra support
00:05:01.430 || 00:05:01.440 || right here
00:05:03.430 || 00:05:03.440 || as well so in the short term you
00:05:05.189 || 00:05:05.199 || actually hit support i'm expecting a
00:05:08.469 || 00:05:08.479 || bounce back to about 52 000 maybe 53 000
00:05:10.629 || 00:05:10.639 || over the next week or so and then i'll
00:05:12.469 || 00:05:12.479 || honestly look to probably take profits
00:05:14.390 || 00:05:14.400 || on my swing trade at that point but
00:05:16.550 || 00:05:16.560 || again it did hit support i do think
00:05:18.870 || 00:05:18.880 || you're due for a small technical bounce
00:05:21.029 || 00:05:21.039 || ultimately my issue is that you still
00:05:23.189 || 00:05:23.199 || have too much leverage in the system the
00:05:25.029 || 00:05:25.039 || stock market i still think has to go
00:05:27.029 || 00:05:27.039 || lower before it bottoms out and that
00:05:29.430 || 00:05:29.440 || inevitably will affect cryptocurrency
00:05:32.070 || 00:05:32.080 || prices and they will come lower as well
00:05:34.310 || 00:05:34.320 || why would stock uh where the stock
00:05:35.909 || 00:05:35.919 || market affect cryptocurrencies what's
00:05:37.270 || 00:05:37.280 || the relationship there
00:05:39.270 || 00:05:39.280 || well the the issue here is you know this
00:05:40.629 || 00:05:40.639 || all goes back to the federal reserve
00:05:42.550 || 00:05:42.560 || right and the fed has pumped in so much
00:05:44.550 || 00:05:44.560 || liquidity into the market made money
00:05:46.230 || 00:05:46.240 || essentially free with interest rates
00:05:48.870 || 00:05:48.880 || near zero and that creates this sense of
00:05:51.029 || 00:05:51.039 || you can always borrow money just keep
00:05:53.110 || 00:05:53.120 || leveraging asset prices will always go
00:05:55.430 || 00:05:55.440 || up up and away and so what happens is
00:05:57.270 || 00:05:57.280 || people in the stock market take leverage
00:05:58.950 || 00:05:58.960 || people in the crypto market take even
00:06:01.110 || 00:06:01.120 || more leverage when you have a draw down
00:06:03.029 || 00:06:03.039 || a sharp drawdown in the stock market
00:06:04.790 || 00:06:04.800 || there's a portion where you're going to
00:06:07.590 || 00:06:07.600 || get margin calls and margins selling and
00:06:09.350 || 00:06:09.360 || what happens is people don't like to
00:06:10.870 || 00:06:10.880 || sell their stocks so what they do is
00:06:12.629 || 00:06:12.639 || they say okay well you know i don't want
00:06:14.710 || 00:06:14.720 || to sell my apple stock or this stock
00:06:16.390 || 00:06:16.400 || because it's dropped so much instead let
00:06:18.629 || 00:06:18.639 || me go sell some crypto let me move that
00:06:20.070 || 00:06:20.080 || money over to this account and you
00:06:22.150 || 00:06:22.160 || create this kind of deleveraging event
00:06:24.710 || 00:06:24.720 || the other side is also fear right so you
00:06:27.670 || 00:06:27.680 || have fear and fear is very pervasive if
00:06:29.510 || 00:06:29.520 || it's in the stock market inevitably it's
00:06:31.749 || 00:06:31.759 || going to bleed into cryptocurrency
00:06:33.909 || 00:06:33.919 || interesting so the two are trading
00:06:35.670 || 00:06:35.680 || concurrently yeah as
00:06:37.990 || 00:06:38.000 || risk assets uh i'd like to clarify the
00:06:39.909 || 00:06:39.919 || downside target for you now because you
00:06:41.830 || 00:06:41.840 || said that you bought a little bit of 48
00:06:44.150 || 00:06:44.160 || 000 is that the floor for you then or do
00:06:46.309 || 00:06:46.319 || you think that should the stock markets
00:06:47.909 || 00:06:47.919 || and we'll talk about the s p 500 and
00:06:50.309 || 00:06:50.319 || nasdaq soon but should the stock markets
00:06:51.990 || 00:06:52.000 || taper down even lower
00:06:55.029 || 00:06:55.039 || will that bring bitcoin down to i'm
00:06:57.110 || 00:06:57.120 || going to bring up 20 000 again is that
00:06:59.270 || 00:06:59.280 || is that still your downside target keep
00:07:00.790 || 00:07:00.800 || bringing it up because eventually it
00:07:02.309 || 00:07:02.319 || will happen and by the way again i
00:07:03.830 || 00:07:03.840 || always have to say this but remember
00:07:05.830 || 00:07:05.840 || folks i love bitcoin i'm a long-term
00:07:08.230 || 00:07:08.240 || bull but i'm also a realist all right
00:07:10.070 || 00:07:10.080 || and realist means that you have to face
00:07:11.990 || 00:07:12.000 || the music sometimes and honestly it's
00:07:14.070 || 00:07:14.080 || just a good place to buy so yes
00:07:16.070 || 00:07:16.080 || ultimately i'm looking for this as a
00:07:17.589 || 00:07:17.599 || swing trade i'm going to unload around
00:07:19.990 || 00:07:20.000 || 50 to 53 000 when bitcoin gets back
00:07:22.070 || 00:07:22.080 || there and then i do expect further
00:07:24.629 || 00:07:24.639 || downside as the deleveraging occurs as
00:07:26.469 || 00:07:26.479 || the fed worries more and more about
00:07:28.469 || 00:07:28.479 || tightening and tapering and kind of
00:07:30.390 || 00:07:30.400 || monitoring inflation they're going to
00:07:33.110 || 00:07:33.120 || have to tighten monetary supply here um
00:07:34.710 || 00:07:34.720 || i just like to point this out this is a
00:07:36.390 || 00:07:36.400 || really interesting point
00:07:39.270 || 00:07:39.280 || you really saw jerome powell do a do a a
00:07:42.390 || 00:07:42.400 || a one you know a 180 flip in terms of
00:07:44.469 || 00:07:44.479 || his kind of chatter right so we saw him
00:07:46.309 || 00:07:46.319 || so dovish you know always giving the
00:07:48.150 || 00:07:48.160 || markets what he wanted then what happens
00:07:50.230 || 00:07:50.240 || he gets reappointed to be the fed chair
00:07:52.710 || 00:07:52.720 || by by president biden now we know that
00:07:54.790 || 00:07:54.800 || the midterms are coming up right in
00:07:57.830 || 00:07:57.840 || 2022. so if you just put the dots and
00:07:59.990 || 00:08:00.000 || connect them you can clearly see that
00:08:01.670 || 00:08:01.680 || biden probably said hey listen jerome
00:08:03.909 || 00:08:03.919 || powell i'll reappoint you but i need you
00:08:06.550 || 00:08:06.560 || to deal with inflation why because a
00:08:08.869 || 00:08:08.879 || huge amount of democratic voters are the
00:08:10.950 || 00:08:10.960 || middle income and lower income people
00:08:13.110 || 00:08:13.120 || who are getting hurt the most by
00:08:14.950 || 00:08:14.960 || inflation so there's a little bit of a
00:08:16.710 || 00:08:16.720 || kind of you know it's not a surprise to
00:08:18.070 || 00:08:18.080 || me that he's getting a little bit more
00:08:20.550 || 00:08:20.560 || hawkish on inflation yeah that makes
00:08:22.309 || 00:08:22.319 || sense let's go back to the technicals
00:08:23.749 || 00:08:23.759 || can you pull up the bitcoin chart one
00:08:24.869 || 00:08:24.879 || more time
00:08:27.270 || 00:08:27.280 || yeah absolutely okay so yeah just keep
00:08:29.270 || 00:08:29.280 || that time frame can you pull up an s p
00:08:32.550 || 00:08:32.560 || 500 chart with the exact same time frame
00:08:39.430 || 00:08:39.440 || here's the s p chart right here march
00:08:40.389 || 00:08:40.399 || okay
00:08:41.430 || 00:08:41.440 || um
00:08:43.509 || 00:08:43.519 || not a perfect correlation but since the
00:08:45.190 || 00:08:45.200 || summer time they've sort of moved in
00:08:47.590 || 00:08:47.600 || tandem you've seen a dip in around july
00:08:49.030 || 00:08:49.040 || august for both
00:08:50.470 || 00:08:50.480 || for both charts
00:08:52.150 || 00:08:52.160 || let's climb back up
00:08:53.910 || 00:08:53.920 || uh peaked around mid-november and
00:08:56.310 || 00:08:56.320 || they've both come down yeah i just find
00:08:58.230 || 00:08:58.240 || that an interesting observation and that
00:08:59.910 || 00:08:59.920 || kind of goes along with the deleveraging
00:09:01.190 || 00:09:01.200 || you know when you see the stock market
00:09:02.870 || 00:09:02.880 || decline in the fear kind of creep in
00:09:04.550 || 00:09:04.560 || that it's going to affect cryptocurrency
00:09:07.269 || 00:09:07.279 || prices absolutely so it's a overall
00:09:09.350 || 00:09:09.360 || macro systemic sell-off it wasn't just
00:09:11.269 || 00:09:11.279 || concentrated on one particular asset
00:09:13.269 || 00:09:13.279 || class that's a that's an important point
00:09:14.870 || 00:09:14.880 || to bring up so let's talk about the
00:09:16.389 || 00:09:16.399 || stock markets now and we can tie that
00:09:19.110 || 00:09:19.120 || back into bitcoin you said that
00:09:21.590 || 00:09:21.600 || the stock market isn't done
00:09:23.590 || 00:09:23.600 || correcting am i right
00:09:24.790 || 00:09:24.800 || right um
00:09:26.630 || 00:09:26.640 || let's talk about that
00:09:28.150 || 00:09:28.160 || all right so so yeah i'm in the camp
00:09:29.829 || 00:09:29.839 || that so right now you're you're still
00:09:31.509 || 00:09:31.519 || technically in this channel right you
00:09:33.190 || 00:09:33.200 || can see this beautiful channel on the
00:09:35.750 || 00:09:35.760 || charts and again you're still you've
00:09:37.110 || 00:09:37.120 || gotten to the low end of it so you're
00:09:38.710 || 00:09:38.720 || getting a little bit of a bounce but
00:09:40.710 || 00:09:40.720 || inevitably i think this breaks through i
00:09:43.030 || 00:09:43.040 || think again you see this channel break
00:09:45.269 || 00:09:45.279 || to the downside and then once you do the
00:09:46.870 || 00:09:46.880 || floodgates can really open you'll have
00:09:48.550 || 00:09:48.560 || some support around these spiders you
00:09:52.150 || 00:09:52.160 || know 427 to 428 level but ultimately i
00:09:54.310 || 00:09:54.320 || don't see how you know you have this
00:09:56.389 || 00:09:56.399 || scenario where this inflation bug is not
00:09:57.990 || 00:09:58.000 || going to go away granted we've seen
00:09:59.829 || 00:09:59.839 || commodity prices come in so it's going
00:10:01.750 || 00:10:01.760 || to look a little bit better but let's be
00:10:04.470 || 00:10:04.480 || honest you know we all know that the the
00:10:06.550 || 00:10:06.560 || rise in wages is going to be something
00:10:07.910 || 00:10:07.920 || that's going to be passed through for
00:10:09.829 || 00:10:09.839 || months if not years to come and it's
00:10:11.110 || 00:10:11.120 || going to keep inflation high it's going
00:10:12.550 || 00:10:12.560 || to keep it above 2
00:10:14.150 || 00:10:14.160 || which means the fed is going to have to
00:10:15.829 || 00:10:15.839 || act aggressively and just like i talked
00:10:18.069 || 00:10:18.079 || about with the midterms coming up it's
00:10:21.350 || 00:10:21.360 || very likely that that uh jerome powell
00:10:23.269 || 00:10:23.279 || will have to continue to stay hawkish at
00:10:25.350 || 00:10:25.360 || least until the midterms to try to kind
00:10:27.430 || 00:10:27.440 || of do what biden wants him to do if
00:10:29.030 || 00:10:29.040 || you're thinking that and if other
00:10:30.870 || 00:10:30.880 || traders potentially might be thinking
00:10:33.030 || 00:10:33.040 || the same thing then one might ask you
00:10:35.269 || 00:10:35.279 || gareth having the markets already priced
00:10:37.350 || 00:10:37.360 || that assumption in
00:10:39.350 || 00:10:39.360 || i mean i haven't heard it in the media
00:10:40.949 || 00:10:40.959 || yet i haven't heard that people have
00:10:42.630 || 00:10:42.640 || speculated on that i always try to be
00:10:44.230 || 00:10:44.240 || kind of one of the first people in terms
00:10:46.949 || 00:10:46.959 || of thinking um so i do think eventually
00:10:48.389 || 00:10:48.399 || it will be priced and i just don't think
00:10:50.550 || 00:10:50.560 || it's there yet all right so what kind of
00:10:52.790 || 00:10:52.800 || a downside are we talking about
00:10:54.790 || 00:10:54.800 || i mean for me i'm kind of looking at at
00:10:56.550 || 00:10:56.560 || you know short-term downside into
00:10:58.949 || 00:10:58.959 || january of of this coming year i think 4
00:11:01.350 || 00:11:01.360 || 30 on the spiders 428 this area right
00:11:03.030 || 00:11:03.040 || here and then we'll have to see if that
00:11:04.710 || 00:11:04.720 || level breaks again i'm always cautious
00:11:06.230 || 00:11:06.240 || to give those longer term opinions
00:11:08.150 || 00:11:08.160 || because anything can happen right but
00:11:10.230 || 00:11:10.240 || you already have kind of cracks emerging
00:11:11.910 || 00:11:11.920 || in the system with the inflation bug
00:11:13.990 || 00:11:14.000 || with the omicron variant and all these
00:11:16.870 || 00:11:16.880 || other things yeah the omicron variant uh
00:11:19.509 || 00:11:19.519 || was i think probably the um
00:11:21.750 || 00:11:21.760 || major catalyst for the sell-off we saw a
00:11:23.190 || 00:11:23.200 || week and a half ago
00:11:25.030 || 00:11:25.040 || it's stabilized more or less
00:11:26.550 || 00:11:26.560 || yeah of course new research is still
00:11:29.389 || 00:11:29.399 || coming out as to is it's uh it's um
00:11:31.509 || 00:11:31.519 || transmissibility and its deadliness so
00:11:33.350 || 00:11:33.360 || we don't know everything that there is
00:11:34.630 || 00:11:34.640 || if i can make it i can give you an
00:11:37.030 || 00:11:37.040 || interesting take on this david so the
00:11:39.509 || 00:11:39.519 || omicron variant is not by itself what
00:11:41.190 || 00:11:41.200 || caused the sell-off in the market right
00:11:42.949 || 00:11:42.959 || because i mean we had we had covered
00:11:44.470 || 00:11:44.480 || back you know i mean we knew about the
00:11:45.910 || 00:11:45.920 || delta variant that didn't stop the
00:11:47.509 || 00:11:47.519 || markets right the markets continued to
00:11:50.389 || 00:11:50.399 || grind up so what the key was is this in
00:11:53.670 || 00:11:53.680 || march of 2020 when covet emerged what
00:11:55.990 || 00:11:56.000 || what was inflation two percent one point
00:11:58.310 || 00:11:58.320 || five percent right so the fed could come
00:12:00.550 || 00:12:00.560 || out with bazookas of money printing and
00:12:02.470 || 00:12:02.480 || do whatever they needed to do to keep
00:12:04.790 || 00:12:04.800 || asset prices up the difference here is
00:12:07.509 || 00:12:07.519 || this with this new variant you can't
00:12:09.670 || 00:12:09.680 || have with inflation at eight percent the
00:12:11.910 || 00:12:11.920 || fed cannot print the same amount of
00:12:13.750 || 00:12:13.760 || money that it did before so it's it's
00:12:16.069 || 00:12:16.079 || the combination of the two that has the
00:12:17.670 || 00:12:17.680 || one market worried they can't be saved
00:12:19.910 || 00:12:19.920 || the fed cannot come to the rescue in the
00:12:22.230 || 00:12:22.240 || same manner as it did for the previous
00:12:23.829 || 00:12:23.839 || initial stage of covet that's an
00:12:24.949 || 00:12:24.959 || interesting theory i haven't thought
00:12:27.430 || 00:12:27.440 || about that what if the markets know
00:12:29.509 || 00:12:29.519 || something about this new variant that
00:12:31.829 || 00:12:31.839 || you and i don't what if
00:12:34.389 || 00:12:34.399 || it actually is riskier and potentially
00:12:36.550 || 00:12:36.560 || more deadly and fatal than the previous
00:12:39.110 || 00:12:39.120 || variants and people are pricing that in
00:12:42.150 || 00:12:42.160 || i mean is that possible
00:12:44.629 || 00:12:44.639 || yeah it absolutely is possible i've been
00:12:46.550 || 00:12:46.560 || really trying to keep a close eye on all
00:12:48.870 || 00:12:48.880 || the news reports coming out about you
00:12:50.230 || 00:12:50.240 || know people that have caught it i
00:12:52.150 || 00:12:52.160 || haven't heard that anyone has died yet
00:12:53.829 || 00:12:53.839 || from it i've heard that the cases are
00:12:56.550 || 00:12:56.560 || generally milder so i'm hopeful that
00:12:57.990 || 00:12:58.000 || that is the case you know not just for
00:12:59.590 || 00:12:59.600 || the stock market but just for life in
00:13:02.069 || 00:13:02.079 || general um but but again like you're
00:13:03.590 || 00:13:03.600 || saying there's always that chance and
00:13:05.350 || 00:13:05.360 || i'm sure the vix is higher because of
00:13:06.870 || 00:13:06.880 || that risk i'm sure the markets have been
00:13:08.550 || 00:13:08.560 || paired back a little bit because there's
00:13:10.230 || 00:13:10.240 || still that small risk that it could be
00:13:12.230 || 00:13:12.240 || much worse i think basically what you're
00:13:13.910 || 00:13:13.920 || saying is gareth if i can summarize your
00:13:16.230 || 00:13:16.240 || thesis is that because of this higher
00:13:17.670 || 00:13:17.680 || inflationary environment that we're in
00:13:19.910 || 00:13:19.920 || the the fed has less ammunition now than
00:13:22.629 || 00:13:22.639 || they did a year ago and so any bad news
00:13:24.550 || 00:13:24.560 || is going to cause a sell-off the markets
00:13:26.389 || 00:13:26.399 || are basically more sensitive now to any
00:13:28.230 || 00:13:28.240 || bad news because the buffer from the fed
00:13:30.230 || 00:13:30.240 || is gone is that right
00:13:32.550 || 00:13:32.560 || you are 100 right you put it perfectly
00:13:34.470 || 00:13:34.480 || for your viewers that is exactly what
00:13:36.470 || 00:13:36.480 || i'm saying all right well uh is there
00:13:39.269 || 00:13:39.279 || any suppose well based on your chart i
00:13:41.509 || 00:13:41.519 || think uh the uh the spy has what the
00:13:43.110 || 00:13:43.120 || four percent four to five percent
00:13:45.509 || 00:13:45.519 || downside to reach your uh to reach your
00:13:48.150 || 00:13:48.160 || floor here um what does that mean for
00:13:50.069 || 00:13:50.079 || bitcoin so suppose we do reach your
00:13:52.710 || 00:13:52.720 || downside target on the spy uh what are
00:13:54.470 || 00:13:54.480 || we going to see bitcoin do
00:13:56.230 || 00:13:56.240 || so i think if you get to 428 on the
00:13:58.629 || 00:13:58.639 || spyders you likely go test the 40 000
00:13:59.910 || 00:13:59.920 || level on bitcoin let me bring up the
00:14:01.910 || 00:14:01.920 || bitcoin chart again so one of the levels
00:14:03.269 || 00:14:03.279 || i'm following on bitcoin there's a
00:14:05.030 || 00:14:05.040 || couple levels from when we rallied off
00:14:07.189 || 00:14:07.199 || 30 000 so if you look right here there's
00:14:08.949 || 00:14:08.959 || a pivot high pivot high pivot high and
00:14:11.670 || 00:14:11.680 || then we broke out so that would be your
00:14:13.910 || 00:14:13.920 || new level right here to look at so that
00:14:15.829 || 00:14:15.839 || would be your downside 40 000 and i
00:14:17.910 || 00:14:17.920 || think that would kind of coincide with
00:14:21.110 || 00:14:21.120 || that 428 to 430 level on the spiders if
00:14:23.750 || 00:14:23.760 || we break below that then the whole new
00:14:26.310 || 00:14:26.320 || game plan comes this low which is at 30
00:14:28.389 || 00:14:28.399 || 000 that would be your next level to
00:14:30.389 || 00:14:30.399 || watch so again these are your next two
00:14:31.910 || 00:14:31.920 || levels you've already hit this area
00:14:33.509 || 00:14:33.519 || which is good support and it's holding
00:14:36.230 || 00:14:36.240 || thus far um we're actually back above 49
00:14:37.910 || 00:14:37.920 || 000 so we'll have to see if my trade
00:14:40.069 || 00:14:40.079 || ends up working out but again if you go
00:14:41.750 || 00:14:41.760 || lower in the s p eventually you'll get
00:14:44.550 || 00:14:44.560 || to 40 000 then thirty thousand and you
00:14:45.990 || 00:14:46.000 || know i hate to say it to people that are
00:14:47.910 || 00:14:47.920 || really just overly bullish but i do
00:14:49.269 || 00:14:49.279 || think twenty thousand is still in the
00:14:51.430 || 00:14:51.440 || cards but again folks let me reiterate
00:14:52.949 || 00:14:52.959 || it has to coincide with a big
00:14:54.389 || 00:14:54.399 || deleveraging and when i say big d
00:14:56.550 || 00:14:56.560 || leveraging i'm talking like 30 to 50 in
00:14:58.230 || 00:14:58.240 || the stock market you'll get bitcoin
00:15:01.590 || 00:15:01.600 || below 20 000. okay and to clarify you
00:15:04.629 || 00:15:04.639 || did say that should bitcoin hold its
00:15:07.910 || 00:15:07.920 || previous all-time high 70 000 is the
00:15:09.750 || 00:15:09.760 || next level right so why haven't we seen
00:15:11.990 || 00:15:12.000 || 70 000 yet because
00:15:14.069 || 00:15:14.079 || i i guess i guess we didn't hold the
00:15:15.990 || 00:15:16.000 || previous all-time high long enough
00:15:17.670 || 00:15:17.680 || yeah so this is really important this is
00:15:19.110 || 00:15:19.120 || this is what i call the confirmation
00:15:20.790 || 00:15:20.800 || signal so you have this this is the
00:15:22.710 || 00:15:22.720 || april high right here notice how you
00:15:24.629 || 00:15:24.639 || closed one day above it here and then
00:15:26.230 || 00:15:26.240 || reversed and then you closed one day
00:15:28.550 || 00:15:28.560 || above it never closed above that high so
00:15:30.310 || 00:15:30.320 || the confirmation signal this is a signal
00:15:32.150 || 00:15:32.160 || i created it's very accurate in
00:15:33.829 || 00:15:33.839 || determining what's a true breakout
00:15:36.230 || 00:15:36.240 || versus a fake breakout and you need so
00:15:38.150 || 00:15:38.160 || when you close above it you need one of
00:15:40.230 || 00:15:40.240 || the subsequent subsequent candles to
00:15:42.870 || 00:15:42.880 || close above the high of that breakout
00:15:45.030 || 00:15:45.040 || candle in neither situation that
00:15:46.629 || 00:15:46.639 || happened to me that's telling me you
00:15:48.870 || 00:15:48.880 || have institutions or big money or whales
00:15:51.430 || 00:15:51.440 || unloading into it and it's likely a fake
00:15:53.269 || 00:15:53.279 || breakout and that's exactly what ended
00:15:55.269 || 00:15:55.279 || up happening i think i think i'm just
00:15:57.350 || 00:15:57.360 || reading the comments from our previous
00:15:59.030 || 00:15:59.040 || interviews people are concerned about
00:16:00.550 || 00:16:00.560 || the exact levels or you're calling
00:16:01.829 || 00:16:01.839 || thirty thousand twenty that it doesn't
00:16:03.990 || 00:16:04.000 || really matter i think the the key is the
00:16:05.910 || 00:16:05.920 || direction that you're predicting
00:16:08.710 || 00:16:08.720 || uh yeah so short term little bit of a
00:16:10.629 || 00:16:10.639 || bounce right i'm long bitcoin right here
00:16:12.069 || 00:16:12.079 || you know i'll go on record and say that
00:16:13.749 || 00:16:13.759 || and uh next time we're on i'll let you
00:16:15.350 || 00:16:15.360 || know if i ended up but if it gets to 52
00:16:17.829 || 00:16:17.839 || 53 000 just assume i'm out and then
00:16:19.990 || 00:16:20.000 || ultimately i think it rolls over again
00:16:22.230 || 00:16:22.240 || down to 40 000 bounces there i'll
00:16:23.829 || 00:16:23.839 || probably look to be a quick buyer there
00:16:25.590 || 00:16:25.600 || for a swing trade but again the stepping
00:16:27.509 || 00:16:27.519 || stone down is what i'm anticipating over
00:16:29.590 || 00:16:29.600 || the next six months and so forth okay i
00:16:30.949 || 00:16:30.959 || want to talk about natural gas real
00:16:33.269 || 00:16:33.279 || quick that had a
00:16:35.189 || 00:16:35.199 || big downside move today what happened
00:16:36.389 || 00:16:36.399 || there yes
00:16:38.230 || 00:16:38.240 || so take a look at this natural gas has
00:16:40.470 || 00:16:40.480 || been pummeled i was a buyer of natural
00:16:42.629 || 00:16:42.639 || gas today folks and i have to show you
00:16:44.389 || 00:16:44.399 || guys this level here this is such a cool
00:16:46.389 || 00:16:46.399 || chart first of all natural gas is down
00:16:48.710 || 00:16:48.720 || from 6.50
00:16:50.710 || 00:16:50.720 || like a month month and a half ago to
00:16:52.550 || 00:16:52.560 || 3.66
00:16:54.230 || 00:16:54.240 || and look at this trend line take the
00:16:57.430 || 00:16:57.440 || previous high from 2018 stretch it right
00:16:59.749 || 00:16:59.759 || here to this high if you if you draw the
00:17:01.910 || 00:17:01.920 || trend line out you broke out above that
00:17:03.670 || 00:17:03.680 || you retrace to what we call the scene of
00:17:05.829 || 00:17:05.839 || the crime and then it ripped up what
00:17:07.590 || 00:17:07.600 || that tells me is this level here at
00:17:11.510 || 00:17:11.520 || around 360 to 365 huge support i am long
00:17:13.110 || 00:17:13.120 || as a swing trade here folks i'm
00:17:15.270 || 00:17:15.280 || expecting a move back above four dollars
00:17:16.549 || 00:17:16.559 || i don't think it'll go much higher than
00:17:19.270 || 00:17:19.280 || that maybe 425 but this is just to me
00:17:21.669 || 00:17:21.679 || these charts are absolutely amazing how
00:17:23.829 || 00:17:23.839 || they tell us where likely support is
00:17:26.069 || 00:17:26.079 || going to be and remember no chart is 100
00:17:27.909 || 00:17:27.919 || it's all probabilities it's going to be
00:17:30.070 || 00:17:30.080 || like 70 80 success rate so that still
00:17:31.750 || 00:17:31.760 || means you'll lose sometimes but the
00:17:33.750 || 00:17:33.760 || charts are the only way i can ever trade
00:17:35.590 || 00:17:35.600 || because they put me in the likely
00:17:37.669 || 00:17:37.679 || scenario of what will happen i'm just
00:17:39.430 || 00:17:39.440 || reading the news on natural gas so i
00:17:40.950 || 00:17:40.960 || think a lot of this drop had to do with
00:17:43.110 || 00:17:43.120 || uh renewed weather projections people
00:17:45.190 || 00:17:45.200 || are now predicting milder temperatures
00:17:46.549 || 00:17:46.559 || which could
00:17:47.669 || 00:17:47.679 || i think the assumption here is that
00:17:49.830 || 00:17:49.840 || people will use less natural gas on a
00:17:51.270 || 00:17:51.280 || technical level though does that look
00:17:53.510 || 00:17:53.520 || oversold to you a huge drop
00:17:55.590 || 00:17:55.600 || hugely oversold right so i mean that's
00:17:57.270 || 00:17:57.280 || part of it too not only is the chart
00:17:59.190 || 00:17:59.200 || level getting tagged today but then you
00:18:01.270 || 00:18:01.280 || also have the oversold situation where
00:18:02.870 || 00:18:02.880 || just in the last really the last what is
00:18:04.789 || 00:18:04.799 || this five days from this close up here
00:18:07.430 || 00:18:07.440 || one two three four five five days down
00:18:08.950 || 00:18:08.960 || it's gone from five dollars and fifty
00:18:11.029 || 00:18:11.039 || cents to three dollars and sixty cents
00:18:13.909 || 00:18:13.919 || at the low today incredibly oversold i
00:18:15.669 || 00:18:15.679 || again i i personally i've been wrong
00:18:17.350 || 00:18:17.360 || before but i expect a technical bounce
00:18:18.230 || 00:18:18.240 || here
00:18:20.310 || 00:18:20.320 || okay well keep tabs on that one as well
00:18:22.870 || 00:18:22.880 || gold let's end on gold you said that
00:18:25.190 || 00:18:25.200 || this is one asset that could be poised
00:18:26.830 || 00:18:26.840 || for a breakout
00:18:29.350 || 00:18:29.360 || um all right well
00:18:31.669 || 00:18:31.679 || well let's let's talk about that again
00:18:33.430 || 00:18:33.440 || yeah because a breakout we have not yet
00:18:34.470 || 00:18:34.480 || seen
00:18:35.909 || 00:18:35.919 || no you haven't seen it and what i want
00:18:37.669 || 00:18:37.679 || to draw on this trend line is this trend
00:18:39.909 || 00:18:39.919 || line right here so take a look so in in
00:18:41.270 || 00:18:41.280 || the past interviews we've done i've
00:18:42.470 || 00:18:42.480 || talked about an inverse head and
00:18:45.270 || 00:18:45.280 || shoulders so you have a shoulder head
00:18:47.669 || 00:18:47.679 || and shoulder and look at how price got
00:18:49.590 || 00:18:49.600 || right up to that trend line right here
00:18:52.150 || 00:18:52.160 || right and notice how it failed so to
00:18:53.669 || 00:18:53.679 || break out in the previous interviews
00:18:55.830 || 00:18:55.840 || we've talked about you need to get above
00:18:57.430 || 00:18:57.440 || this level which is right now around
00:18:59.430 || 00:18:59.440 || 1875
00:19:01.830 || 00:19:01.840 || on gold on spot gold so that's what
00:19:03.270 || 00:19:03.280 || you're following but this is a great
00:19:05.029 || 00:19:05.039 || example how resistance works it went
00:19:07.029 || 00:19:07.039 || right to that trend line got pounded
00:19:09.430 || 00:19:09.440 || down i'm still in the camp that pullback
00:19:11.270 || 00:19:11.280 || should be used as buying opportunities
00:19:12.950 || 00:19:12.960 || um i do think eventually it's gonna
00:19:14.470 || 00:19:14.480 || break this level probably within the
00:19:16.789 || 00:19:16.799 || next month or two and then once it does
00:19:18.789 || 00:19:18.799 || that's where the real momentum comes in
00:19:20.630 || 00:19:20.640 || you'll see like i don't want to say a
00:19:22.310 || 00:19:22.320 || bitcoin type move because that's just
00:19:24.230 || 00:19:24.240 || you know that was just meteoric from 10
00:19:26.870 || 00:19:26.880 || 000 to 65 000 but i do think you'll go
00:19:29.909 || 00:19:29.919 || very quickly to the highs from 2020
00:19:31.789 || 00:19:31.799 || which were around 20
00:19:34.310 || 00:19:34.320 || 2065 and i think you'll even get as high
00:19:36.789 || 00:19:36.799 || as 3 000 by the end of 2022. well can
00:19:37.990 || 00:19:38.000 || you explain how you reached that
00:19:39.350 || 00:19:39.360 || conclusion because if i'm just looking
00:19:41.029 || 00:19:41.039 || at this chart that you have in front of
00:19:43.430 || 00:19:43.440 || me gareth it looks like
00:19:45.190 || 00:19:45.200 || that it looks like gold has been
00:19:47.190 || 00:19:47.200 || consistently making lower highs
00:19:49.270 || 00:19:49.280 || throughout the year starting from august
00:19:51.029 || 00:19:51.039 || it's come down in fact the trend line
00:19:52.630 || 00:19:52.640 || you just drew
00:19:54.549 || 00:19:54.559 || is is downward sloping isn't that yeah
00:19:56.150 || 00:19:56.160 || so if i were to follow the trend line i
00:19:57.270 || 00:19:57.280 || would assume that it would keep going
00:19:58.310 || 00:19:58.320 || lower
00:19:59.909 || 00:19:59.919 || right but what you want to do here in
00:20:01.669 || 00:20:01.679 || this situation as a technical trader is
00:20:03.430 || 00:20:03.440 || zoom out on the chart and if you zoom
00:20:05.350 || 00:20:05.360 || out on the chart you have this big move
00:20:07.909 || 00:20:07.919 || up going all the way back to 2018 and
00:20:09.830 || 00:20:09.840 || then notice how this is all bullish
00:20:11.990 || 00:20:12.000 || consolidation so when you get a huge
00:20:13.830 || 00:20:13.840 || move think of a marathon runner how a
00:20:16.149 || 00:20:16.159 || marathon runner runs a marathon you
00:20:18.070 || 00:20:18.080 || can't say oh go run another marathon for
00:20:19.830 || 00:20:19.840 || me the second they finish they need to
00:20:21.669 || 00:20:21.679 || kind of refuel when you see
00:20:23.590 || 00:20:23.600 || consolidation where price kind of stays
00:20:25.510 || 00:20:25.520 || relatively close to those highs in
00:20:27.669 || 00:20:27.679 || comparison to the big move up that's the
00:20:30.149 || 00:20:30.159 || refueling stage that's digestion of the
00:20:32.070 || 00:20:32.080 || big move and it's actually a bullish
00:20:33.990 || 00:20:34.000 || setup it's known as a bull flag and
00:20:35.909 || 00:20:35.919 || ultimately you expect the next leg up to
00:20:37.590 || 00:20:37.600 || come from that
00:20:39.430 || 00:20:39.440 || last summer we had unprecedented
00:20:41.190 || 00:20:41.200 || monetary stimulus which was one of the
00:20:42.950 || 00:20:42.960 || contributing factors to the run-up we
00:20:45.990 || 00:20:46.000 || saw like you said the fed kind of is
00:20:48.710 || 00:20:48.720 || limited and it's in its in its toolkit
00:20:50.870 || 00:20:50.880 || right now can't print as much as it can
00:20:52.310 || 00:20:52.320 || last year without
00:20:54.630 || 00:20:54.640 || spiking inflation up even higher does
00:20:56.950 || 00:20:56.960 || that mean though gareth does that mean
00:20:57.909 || 00:20:57.919 || that
00:20:59.990 || 00:21:00.000 || gold wouldn't have the same
00:21:05.350 || 00:21:05.360 || i'm still in the camp that it still has
00:21:07.430 || 00:21:07.440 || tailwinds i still think uh interest
00:21:08.870 || 00:21:08.880 || rates will go higher because of
00:21:10.390 || 00:21:10.400 || inflation because inflation is going to
00:21:12.390 || 00:21:12.400 || be persistent over the next six to 12
00:21:14.230 || 00:21:14.240 || months so i do think that'll drive
00:21:15.510 || 00:21:15.520 || interest rates up now interest rates
00:21:16.950 || 00:21:16.960 || can't go that high right because of the
00:21:18.950 || 00:21:18.960 || government debt we know that in terms of
00:21:20.710 || 00:21:20.720 || the payments so the fed will try to keep
00:21:22.710 || 00:21:22.720 || a lid on interest rates while also
00:21:24.870 || 00:21:24.880 || getting inflation under control i think
00:21:26.549 || 00:21:26.559 || it's they're in a box at this point but
00:21:28.230 || 00:21:28.240 || ultimately you know if you look back at
00:21:30.549 || 00:21:30.559 || the 70s in the early 80s you had the
00:21:32.870 || 00:21:32.880 || same situation where going into that
00:21:34.630 || 00:21:34.640 || inflationary period you have high
00:21:36.310 || 00:21:36.320 || inflation for three or four years and
00:21:38.630 || 00:21:38.640 || gold did nothing it went sideways and
00:21:39.990 || 00:21:40.000 || then in the second part of that
00:21:41.990 || 00:21:42.000 || inflationary period in the kind of the
00:21:45.510 || 00:21:45.520 || late 70s into the 80s gold ripped up and
00:21:46.789 || 00:21:46.799 || again it's kind of almost a delayed
00:21:48.630 || 00:21:48.640 || reaction and i think bitcoin might even
00:21:50.549 || 00:21:50.559 || have delayed it even more because so
00:21:52.310 || 00:21:52.320 || much money has kind of been sucked into
00:21:53.830 || 00:21:53.840 || bitcoin but actually the decline in
00:21:55.750 || 00:21:55.760 || bitcoin if people start getting very
00:21:57.990 || 00:21:58.000 || bearish you could see a rotation back to
00:22:00.630 || 00:22:00.640 || gold um as the primary way to play
00:22:03.270 || 00:22:03.280 || protection against against inflation
00:22:05.270 || 00:22:05.280 || okay so if you were to bet on gold would
00:22:08.070 || 00:22:08.080 || you say that 2022 would be a better year
00:22:10.950 || 00:22:10.960 || than 2021 for the yellow metal
00:22:12.870 || 00:22:12.880 || i do think so absolutely considering the
00:22:14.630 || 00:22:14.640 || consolidation and i i'll even go out on
00:22:16.070 || 00:22:16.080 || a limb and say i think that bitcoin
00:22:18.549 || 00:22:18.559 || could actually outperform from from you
00:22:20.630 || 00:22:20.640 || know this point here could outperform
00:22:23.029 || 00:22:23.039 || bitcoin in 2022 even though long-term
00:22:25.270 || 00:22:25.280 || bitcoin will outperform gold you meant
00:22:27.510 || 00:22:27.520 || gold would outperform bitcoin right yes
00:22:30.390 || 00:22:30.400 || yes gold will outperform bitcoin in 2022
00:22:31.990 || 00:22:32.000 || wow even though even though over the
00:22:33.909 || 00:22:33.919 || next 10 years i expect bitcoin to
00:22:36.149 || 00:22:36.159 || outperform gold over the next 10 years
00:22:38.710 || 00:22:38.720 || okay but just next year okay wow
00:22:40.390 || 00:22:40.400 || basically yeah basically with bitcoin
00:22:41.750 || 00:22:41.760 || it's just that bitcoin needs a flush
00:22:43.510 || 00:22:43.520 || before it can resume its dramatic move
00:22:45.669 || 00:22:45.679 || to the upside while gold honestly is
00:22:47.029 || 00:22:47.039 || still at levels where it's very
00:22:49.830 || 00:22:49.840 || attractive it hasn't had a huge move yet
00:22:50.950 || 00:22:50.960 || okay
00:22:53.350 || 00:22:53.360 || well all right great analysis let's see
00:22:55.590 || 00:22:55.600 || uh let's see which one flushes out first
00:22:57.590 || 00:22:57.600 || and which one moves up more uh in the
