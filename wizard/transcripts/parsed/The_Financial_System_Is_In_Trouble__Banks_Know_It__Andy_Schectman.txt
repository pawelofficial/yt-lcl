00:00:02.030 || 00:00:02.040 || take a look at the amount of money in
00:00:03.649 || 00:00:03.659 || the reverse repo Market over two
00:00:06.110 || 00:00:06.120 || trillion dollars the reverse repo Market
00:00:09.110 || 00:00:09.120 || is it's a mechanism whereby when the
00:00:11.150 || 00:00:11.160 || banks have in their mind too much money
00:00:13.490 || 00:00:13.500 || they will give it to the Federal Reserve
00:00:16.430 || 00:00:16.440 || for overnight loans so right now it is
00:00:18.590 || 00:00:18.600 || the idea of the bank said hey we would
00:00:21.470 || 00:00:21.480 || feel safer putting two trillion dollars
00:00:24.230 || 00:00:24.240 || in the reverse repo Market safely parked
00:00:26.029 || 00:00:26.039 || at the FED earning three percent then
00:00:28.250 || 00:00:28.260 || lending it out to URI for a car loan or
00:00:30.170 || 00:00:30.180 || home equity loan or even a credit card
00:00:32.630 || 00:00:32.640 || earning many times what they are getting
00:00:34.610 || 00:00:34.620 || was safety what they are telling you
00:00:37.490 || 00:00:37.500 || without saying is that they're scared
00:00:39.709 || 00:00:39.719 || this is Kaiser Johnson with liberty and

00:01:59.510 || 00:01:59.520 || Liberty and finance
00:02:01.490 || 00:02:01.500 || done again great to see you it's like
00:02:04.730 || 00:02:04.740 || Groundhog Day all over again and I think
00:02:06.709 || 00:02:06.719 || 2023 is going to be an interesting year
00:02:10.249 || 00:02:10.259 || certainly 2022 was and we'll talk a
00:02:12.770 || 00:02:12.780 || little bit about that but I think 2023
00:02:14.930 || 00:02:14.940 || will if I had to guess we'll take the
00:02:17.510 || 00:02:17.520 || cake well Happy New Year to you
00:02:20.330 || 00:02:20.340 || likewise and last time we spoke you said
00:02:21.949 || 00:02:21.959 || you were really looking forward to a
00:02:23.089 || 00:02:23.099 || little break over the holidays and
00:02:24.530 || 00:02:24.540 || getting some eggnog and being with
00:02:27.470 || 00:02:27.480 || family and we did the same and uh glad
00:02:29.890 || 00:02:29.900 || to hear that you had a recuperating time
00:02:32.809 || 00:02:32.819 || yeah it's important you know it seems
00:02:35.030 || 00:02:35.040 || that the last few years have been very
00:02:38.869 || 00:02:38.879 || chaotic in so many ways not just in this
00:02:40.910 || 00:02:40.920 || industry and and the things that we talk
00:02:43.610 || 00:02:43.620 || about but life in general so you know
00:02:45.350 || 00:02:45.360 || that's part of the reason I think as we
00:02:48.170 || 00:02:48.180 || talked about we saw a slow down across
00:02:49.729 || 00:02:49.739 || the board in the entire industry
00:02:51.949 || 00:02:51.959 || everyone I talked to said the same thing
00:02:53.690 || 00:02:53.700 || it was like a light switch shut off
00:02:55.850 || 00:02:55.860 || right around Thanksgiving and it makes
00:02:57.770 || 00:02:57.780 || sense to me done again it makes sense in
00:02:59.630 || 00:02:59.640 || that we've all been bottled up for so
00:03:03.530 || 00:03:03.540 || long caged up the ability to go out and
00:03:05.869 || 00:03:05.879 || travel and see family and and enjoy the
00:03:07.910 || 00:03:07.920 || holidays and kind of let your hair down
00:03:09.110 || 00:03:09.120 || without
00:03:11.990 || 00:03:12.000 || you know the burden of of of the
00:03:14.449 || 00:03:14.459 || pandemic hanging over I think
00:03:16.610 || 00:03:16.620 || um made a big difference and I think it
00:03:19.490 || 00:03:19.500 || was just nice for people to get out and
00:03:22.430 || 00:03:22.440 || uh enjoy the holidays so
00:03:23.750 || 00:03:23.760 || um but it's good to be here and
00:03:26.390 || 00:03:26.400 || certainly it was nice to to have that
00:03:28.070 || 00:03:28.080 || time but I'm recharged and looking
00:03:30.649 || 00:03:30.659 || forward to uh seeing what the world's
00:03:32.210 || 00:03:32.220 || gonna throw at us here this year with
00:03:33.830 || 00:03:33.840 || you every Tuesday
00:03:35.449 || 00:03:35.459 || that's one of the things we just alluded
00:03:37.430 || 00:03:37.440 || to a minute ago is a look back at 2022
00:03:39.290 || 00:03:39.300 || and look ahead at 2023 are there any
00:03:40.970 || 00:03:40.980 || particular highlights you want to call
00:03:42.890 || 00:03:42.900 || out to bring people's attentions to if
00:03:45.649 || 00:03:45.659 || the context that 2022 provides for us
00:03:48.530 || 00:03:48.540 || and the Outlook that you see in the the
00:03:50.630 || 00:03:50.640 || tea leaves for 2023
00:03:52.729 || 00:03:52.739 || yeah well first I'd like to talk about
00:03:55.190 || 00:03:55.200 || let's just look at the basics so gold
00:03:57.229 || 00:03:57.239 || and silver outperformed both gold and
00:04:00.350 || 00:04:00.360 || silver outperform the stock indexes the
00:04:02.270 || 00:04:02.280 || bond market the real estate market and
00:04:05.449 || 00:04:05.459 || the crypto Market in 2022 and yes there
00:04:07.789 || 00:04:07.799 || are those that would argue that it did
00:04:09.949 || 00:04:09.959 || not accentuate the way that many people
00:04:13.250 || 00:04:13.260 || thought it would and I would argue that
00:04:15.110 || 00:04:15.120 || um the jury is still out on that that
00:04:17.569 || 00:04:17.579 || the the music hasn't stopped yet but
00:04:19.550 || 00:04:19.560 || certainly when we look at it in in
00:04:22.129 || 00:04:22.139 || respect to traditional assets and in
00:04:24.650 || 00:04:24.660 || terms of the crypto Market which seemed
00:04:26.450 || 00:04:26.460 || to outpace everything for the last
00:04:29.150 || 00:04:29.160 || several years gold and silver did very
00:04:31.310 || 00:04:31.320 || very well in fact Friday's close and
00:04:33.170 || 00:04:33.180 || it's up again here today as we speak
00:04:36.350 || 00:04:36.360 || Tuesday but Fridays close
00:04:39.110 || 00:04:39.120 || um prior to the end of the new year was
00:04:41.689 || 00:04:41.699 || the highest weekly finish for gold in
00:04:44.510 || 00:04:44.520 || six months and the highest weekly uh
00:04:47.450 || 00:04:47.460 || goal close for silver in eight months
00:04:50.390 || 00:04:50.400 || and you know when you look back over the
00:04:52.670 || 00:04:52.680 || correction that we had in the middle of
00:04:55.310 || 00:04:55.320 || the Year September October we see gold
00:04:58.730 || 00:04:58.740 || up over 200 since its local point and
00:05:01.850 || 00:05:01.860 || silver up by six points from their
00:05:04.969 || 00:05:04.979 || respected lows it's also important to
00:05:06.590 || 00:05:06.600 || reflect on the strength of the dollar
00:05:09.710 || 00:05:09.720 || you know gold was unchanged basically
00:05:12.469 || 00:05:12.479 || almost to the penny unchanged in 2022
00:05:15.110 || 00:05:15.120 || from the start to the end on a year-end
00:05:19.129 || 00:05:19.139 || basis in dollar terms but in terms of
00:05:20.150 || 00:05:20.160 || like
00:05:22.550 || 00:05:22.560 || um the UK or the Euros in the UK in
00:05:27.070 || 00:05:27.080 || Euros gold was up 5.8 percent and up
00:05:31.790 || 00:05:31.800 || 11.8 in UK terms and setting an all-time
00:05:33.230 || 00:05:33.240 || high
00:05:35.629 || 00:05:35.639 || uh against the
00:05:38.950 || 00:05:38.960 || um the Euro 19 Nation Euro currency at
00:05:41.990 || 00:05:42.000 || 1902 euros and
00:05:43.850 || 00:05:43.860 || um you know so what we were seeing here
00:05:46.670 || 00:05:46.680 || in the states is an example of a very
00:05:49.189 || 00:05:49.199 || strong dollar that was making gold and
00:05:52.310 || 00:05:52.320 || silver not appear the way that they
00:05:55.430 || 00:05:55.440 || they did the rest of the world I think
00:05:57.650 || 00:05:57.660 || one of the takeaways that I look at 2022
00:06:00.469 || 00:06:00.479 || is that the central banks have an
00:06:03.409 || 00:06:03.419 || insatiable appetite for gold and seem to
00:06:05.270 || 00:06:05.280 || not be able to get enough in fact in the
00:06:07.670 || 00:06:07.680 || third quarter the official net gold
00:06:10.189 || 00:06:10.199 || purchases were approximately 400 metric
00:06:11.689 || 00:06:11.699 || tons somewhere in the neighborhood of 20
00:06:13.670 || 00:06:13.680 || billion dollars and it was the most in
00:06:16.310 || 00:06:16.320 || over a half century and if you look at a
00:06:17.330 || 00:06:17.340 || graph
00:06:19.189 || 00:06:19.199 || you'll see there's really all the way
00:06:21.590 || 00:06:21.600 || back there's really nothing even close
00:06:25.309 || 00:06:25.319 || to it the next closest was somewhere I
00:06:29.350 || 00:06:29.360 || think like 2018 they there were 247 tons
00:06:32.450 || 00:06:32.460 || purchased by the central banks nearly
00:06:34.610 || 00:06:34.620 || double what we saw
00:06:37.850 || 00:06:37.860 || um this year or in 2022 rather you can
00:06:39.710 || 00:06:39.720 || look at specific examples of countries
00:06:42.770 || 00:06:42.780 || like turkey who we've talked about for a
00:06:46.010 || 00:06:46.020 || very long time uh were you know we're
00:06:48.590 || 00:06:48.600 || leading the way in 2022 with their gold
00:06:50.629 || 00:06:50.639 || purchases
00:06:51.670 || 00:06:51.680 || um
00:06:55.730 || 00:06:55.740 || 38.9 tons of gold just in the month of
00:06:59.629 || 00:06:59.639 || November uh that the the year-end totals
00:07:01.749 || 00:07:01.759 || for turkey ended up somewhere north of
00:07:06.469 || 00:07:06.479 || 225 tons compared to the only 56 tons
00:07:08.930 || 00:07:08.940 || they purchased the year before you can
00:07:10.730 || 00:07:10.740 || look at a country like India who who
00:07:13.370 || 00:07:13.380 || purchased over 300 million ounces of
00:07:15.890 || 00:07:15.900 || silver that's more than 35 percent of
00:07:19.010 || 00:07:19.020 || the of the total global wine supply so
00:07:20.990 || 00:07:21.000 || the the central banks are gobbling up
00:07:26.029 || 00:07:26.039 || metal that is absolutely a certainty and
00:07:28.370 || 00:07:28.380 || when we look at the way that this is
00:07:31.550 || 00:07:31.560 || affecting things for example uh on comex
00:07:35.529 || 00:07:35.539 || uh we notice that comex had
00:07:39.409 || 00:07:39.419 || 354 million ounces of silver at the
00:07:42.249 || 00:07:42.259 || beginning of the year ended the year at
00:07:45.710 || 00:07:45.720 || 299 million ounces almost all of the
00:07:49.670 || 00:07:49.680 || decline in the silver market on Comax
00:07:52.129 || 00:07:52.139 || roughly 55 million ounces came out of
00:07:54.290 || 00:07:54.300 || the registered category that is the
00:07:56.390 || 00:07:56.400 || category of bars that are available for
00:07:58.309 || 00:07:58.319 || delivery it is what is backing the price
00:08:01.850 || 00:08:01.860 || setting mechanism of the West and down
00:08:04.850 || 00:08:04.860 || to roughly 34 million ounces that's it
00:08:08.150 || 00:08:08.160 || so more silver was deducted out of the
00:08:10.490 || 00:08:10.500 || registered category than is left in the
00:08:13.010 || 00:08:13.020 || registered category which is roughly 10
00:08:14.930 || 00:08:14.940 || times less than the country of India
00:08:17.749 || 00:08:17.759 || purchase you can see we are beginning to
00:08:21.409 || 00:08:21.419 || draw down on the major Supply Centers
00:08:24.469 || 00:08:24.479 || we've that was a big theme of 2022 but
00:08:26.089 || 00:08:26.099 || interestingly enough
00:08:28.909 || 00:08:28.919 || everyone talked about silver all year
00:08:31.369 || 00:08:31.379 || long the the percentage decline in
00:08:35.930 || 00:08:35.940 || silver which worked out to 14 decline in
00:08:39.050 || 00:08:39.060 || in the registered tax gold inventories
00:08:42.529 || 00:08:42.539 || fell by over 30 percent from 33.6
00:08:45.050 || 00:08:45.060 || million ounces to 23.2 million ounces
00:08:48.470 || 00:08:48.480 || it's a much larger actually drawdown of
00:08:51.170 || 00:08:51.180 || Supply than everyone focusing on Silver
00:08:53.570 || 00:08:53.580 || quietly gold is being drained at the
00:08:56.570 || 00:08:56.580 || same time we talked about how in one day
00:08:59.630 || 00:08:59.640 || some mysterious buyer was able to
00:09:02.570 || 00:09:02.580 || purchase 26 million ounces or 45 percent
00:09:04.850 || 00:09:04.860 || of all the kilo bars held on the comex
00:09:07.430 || 00:09:07.440 || this is this is a very unusual time in
00:09:09.470 || 00:09:09.480 || all the years I've done this we never
00:09:12.290 || 00:09:12.300 || would see anything even remotely close
00:09:14.590 || 00:09:14.600 || to the number of ounces
00:09:17.269 || 00:09:17.279 || that have been drawn down off of the
00:09:19.490 || 00:09:19.500 || exchanges and it's not just the comex as
00:09:21.110 || 00:09:21.120 || we talked about quite a bit on your show
00:09:23.449 || 00:09:23.459 || the available inventories on the London
00:09:25.850 || 00:09:25.860 || Metals exchange have plunge and it's not
00:09:27.829 || 00:09:27.839 || just gold and silver that we always talk
00:09:30.410 || 00:09:30.420 || about they have six main Metals traded
00:09:34.490 || 00:09:34.500 || on the London Metals exchange and those
00:09:38.269 || 00:09:38.279 || metals cumulatively
00:09:41.570 || 00:09:41.580 || 22 saw a 66 percent decline on average
00:09:46.190 || 00:09:46.200 || 72 percent in aluminum uh zinc shrank by
00:09:49.970 || 00:09:49.980 || 90 and so the countries that are pulling
00:09:51.829 || 00:09:51.839 || all of this metal off
00:09:53.750 || 00:09:53.760 || and I'd argue they're the brics Nations
00:09:56.690 || 00:09:56.700 || predominantly China they look at these
00:09:59.030 || 00:09:59.040 || Commodities as wealth and so they are
00:10:01.490 || 00:10:01.500 || accumulating a stockpile of War chest if
00:10:03.230 || 00:10:03.240 || you will of everything from Industrial
00:10:05.630 || 00:10:05.640 || Metals to precious metals and base
00:10:08.990 || 00:10:09.000 || metals and everything in between
00:10:11.150 || 00:10:11.160 || um and I think that this is something to
00:10:14.030 || 00:10:14.040 || take really really take note of that the
00:10:17.269 || 00:10:17.279 || epicenter of availability in everything
00:10:20.269 || 00:10:20.279 || from copper to gold and everything in
00:10:23.210 || 00:10:23.220 || between is showing massive drawdowns and
00:10:25.730 || 00:10:25.740 || and this is I I think a trend that we
00:10:28.130 || 00:10:28.140 || will see certainly
00:10:32.030 || 00:10:32.040 || um moving forward when we look at Silver
00:10:36.110 || 00:10:36.120 || in 2022 the silver Institute came out
00:10:38.870 || 00:10:38.880 || and told us that this is the largest
00:10:41.570 || 00:10:41.580 || deficit that we've seen in in decades
00:10:44.569 || 00:10:44.579 || multi-decade deficit between the amount
00:10:46.490 || 00:10:46.500 || of silver that was demanded and the
00:10:48.470 || 00:10:48.480 || silver that was pulled out of the ground
00:10:51.710 || 00:10:51.720 || and you know it's interesting that there
00:10:53.630 || 00:10:53.640 || telling us it was almost 200 million
00:10:55.790 || 00:10:55.800 || ounces about 195 million ounces
00:10:59.030 || 00:10:59.040 || shortfall but no one ever talks about
00:11:00.829 || 00:11:00.839 || the fact that the silver Institute
00:11:05.990 || 00:11:06.000 || throws into this equation Recycling and
00:11:08.150 || 00:11:08.160 || recycling
00:11:11.870 || 00:11:11.880 || um in 2022 I believe was somewhere in
00:11:14.630 || 00:11:14.640 || the neighborhood of 845 million ounces
00:11:19.009 || 00:11:19.019 || they expect it to increase
00:11:21.350 || 00:11:21.360 || um this year and for a third straight
00:11:25.009 || 00:11:25.019 || year and you know you're talking a huge
00:11:27.470 || 00:11:27.480 || amount of silver cycling if you pull the
00:11:31.370 || 00:11:31.380 || recycle out of the numbers the total
00:11:34.850 || 00:11:34.860 || Mine Supply then drops from
00:11:36.170 || 00:11:36.180 || you know somewhere in the neighborhood
00:11:39.710 || 00:11:39.720 || of 800 million ounces to 662 or 663
00:11:42.710 || 00:11:42.720 || million ounces which really shows you
00:11:45.949 || 00:11:45.959 || the discrepancy between mind supply and
00:11:48.769 || 00:11:48.779 || demand and it is growing uh this year
00:11:51.410 || 00:11:51.420 || they there is a forecast of over 1.1
00:11:54.829 || 00:11:54.839 || billion ounces that will be demanded
00:11:59.150 || 00:11:59.160 || um and against a shortfall of at least a
00:12:00.650 || 00:12:00.660 || couple hundred million ounces and when
00:12:02.690 || 00:12:02.700 || you pull recycling out that number could
00:12:04.009 || 00:12:04.019 || be as big as four to five hundred
00:12:06.829 || 00:12:06.839 || million ounces the moral of the story is
00:12:08.930 || 00:12:08.940 || silver is depleting and when you talk
00:12:11.210 || 00:12:11.220 || about pulling recycling out and only
00:12:13.490 || 00:12:13.500 || looking at available Mine Supply it is
00:12:15.470 || 00:12:15.480 || becoming harder and harder and harder to
00:12:17.210 || 00:12:17.220 || pull metal out of the ground and this is
00:12:21.350 || 00:12:21.360 || why the silver to gold ratio is so very
00:12:25.370 || 00:12:25.380 || very important a price ratio of of 76 to
00:12:26.930 || 00:12:26.940 || 1 right now
00:12:31.730 || 00:12:31.740 || uh in relation to a mine mining ratio of
00:12:33.769 || 00:12:33.779 || seven to one but I think it's really
00:12:35.690 || 00:12:35.700 || important to underscore something too
00:12:37.250 || 00:12:37.260 || then again and that is that the silver
00:12:40.550 || 00:12:40.560 || prices uh you know closing the year at
00:12:44.449 || 00:12:44.459 || 24 over 24 up for the year even though
00:12:47.090 || 00:12:47.100 || they didn't go crazy they held up very
00:12:50.090 || 00:12:50.100 || very well in the face of such a strong
00:12:53.509 || 00:12:53.519 || dollar multi-year highs in the dollar
00:12:55.430 || 00:12:55.440 || right everyone talked about the strength
00:12:57.710 || 00:12:57.720 || of the dollar from a perspective point
00:12:59.990 || 00:13:00.000 || of view the last time the dollar was
00:13:02.269 || 00:13:02.279 || this strong silver was less than five
00:13:04.850 || 00:13:04.860 || dollars an ounce so this just goes to
00:13:07.850 || 00:13:07.860 || show how strong silver demand is holding
00:13:11.150 || 00:13:11.160 || up in the face of an incredibly strong
00:13:13.250 || 00:13:13.260 || dollar and it's important to note that
00:13:15.230 || 00:13:15.240 || over the last two decades the
00:13:16.610 || 00:13:16.620 || correlation
00:13:19.430 || 00:13:19.440 || between the U.S dollar Index and silver
00:13:23.150 || 00:13:23.160 || Futures is really really crazy it's like
00:13:25.910 || 00:13:25.920 || it's uncanny as a matter of fact when
00:13:29.629 || 00:13:29.639 || the US dollar Rises silver gets hit when
00:13:32.329 || 00:13:32.339 || the U.S dollar Falls uh silver
00:13:36.110 || 00:13:36.120 || outperforms and you know because all of
00:13:38.389 || 00:13:38.399 || the global Commodities are priced in US
00:13:41.449 || 00:13:41.459 || dollars as the U.S dollar begins to
00:13:43.009 || 00:13:43.019 || weaken and we've seen that here the last
00:13:44.629 || 00:13:44.639 || few weeks of the year it seems to have
00:13:48.829 || 00:13:48.839 || turned over as the U.S dollar weakens
00:13:51.050 || 00:13:51.060 || um we would expect all Commodities to
00:13:53.329 || 00:13:53.339 || catch a bid and maybe that's exactly why
00:13:55.730 || 00:13:55.740 || you're seeing not just precious metals
00:13:57.769 || 00:13:57.779 || disappear off the the London medals
00:13:59.449 || 00:13:59.459 || exchange but also the base and
00:14:02.329 || 00:14:02.339 || Industrial Metals it's a a very big deal
00:14:06.230 || 00:14:06.240 || when we talk about a gold to Silver
00:14:09.650 || 00:14:09.660 || ratio right now of 76 to 1. roughly that
00:14:12.829 || 00:14:12.839 || implies it takes 76 ounces of silver to
00:14:15.050 || 00:14:15.060 || equal one ounce of gold and from a
00:14:17.150 || 00:14:17.160 || historical perspective the last two
00:14:20.509 || 00:14:20.519 || years has in 200 years has averaged
00:14:24.650 || 00:14:24.660 || roughly 43 to 1. so we are way way above
00:14:26.870 || 00:14:26.880 || where it is average for the last 200
00:14:29.030 || 00:14:29.040 || years knowing also that it's coming out
00:14:31.610 || 00:14:31.620 || of the ground at seven to one you could
00:14:35.150 || 00:14:35.160 || argue we're 11 times undervalued in
00:14:37.430 || 00:14:37.440 || silver just based upon its geologic
00:14:40.370 || 00:14:40.380 || footprint in relation to Gold but more
00:14:42.350 || 00:14:42.360 || importantly we did see a ratio that
00:14:45.710 || 00:14:45.720 || peaked at over 92 to 1 this year and any
00:14:47.990 || 00:14:48.000 || time in history any time in history
00:14:50.449 || 00:14:50.459 || where silver has achieved a ratio in
00:14:53.269 || 00:14:53.279 || comparison to Gold of 92 to 1 or better
00:14:56.269 || 00:14:56.279 || it has started an epic turnaround and in
00:14:58.550 || 00:14:58.560 || some cases it took a few years other
00:15:01.550 || 00:15:01.560 || cases like 2010 to 11 only took a few
00:15:04.670 || 00:15:04.680 || months but the the the movement has
00:15:06.470 || 00:15:06.480 || often been explosive now this has
00:15:10.009 || 00:15:10.019 || happened four times since 2000 I would
00:15:12.290 || 00:15:12.300 || expect this one to be much much much
00:15:15.230 || 00:15:15.240 || stronger because of the drawdown in
00:15:18.710 || 00:15:18.720 || physical Supply off of the comex so you
00:15:21.050 || 00:15:21.060 || know from a perspective
00:15:25.069 || 00:15:25.079 || of what we saw in 2022 just specifically
00:15:27.769 || 00:15:27.779 || talking about the metals and what we see
00:15:30.350 || 00:15:30.360 || moving forward I am incredibly
00:15:35.290 || 00:15:35.300 || optimistic that 2023 will will
00:15:39.410 || 00:15:39.420 || finally Usher in the prices that many of
00:15:41.569 || 00:15:41.579 || us have expected for a very long time
00:15:45.650 || 00:15:45.660 || and that is mostly based upon things
00:15:47.870 || 00:15:47.880 || such as an overly strong dollar that
00:15:50.030 || 00:15:50.040 || seems to be turning over massive
00:15:52.790 || 00:15:52.800 || industrial demand massive demand from
00:15:55.490 || 00:15:55.500 || the sophisticated accredited investors
00:15:57.470 || 00:15:57.480 || who not only are buying everything in
00:16:00.170 || 00:16:00.180 || the retail space but also drawing down
00:16:03.170 || 00:16:03.180 || from from the comex and the lme I think
00:16:04.850 || 00:16:04.860 || there is a lot of reason to be
00:16:08.030 || 00:16:08.040 || optimistic as it pertains to what the
00:16:12.889 || 00:16:12.899 || price will be in 2023 and 2022 or the
00:16:15.350 || 00:16:15.360 || very end of it I think is really showing
00:16:17.509 || 00:16:17.519 || us the setup and the setup is now in
00:16:19.310 || 00:16:19.320 || place done again for for massive price
00:16:21.769 || 00:16:21.779 || rallies into the new year in the middle
00:16:25.069 || 00:16:25.079 || of that uh update you mentioned record
00:16:27.290 || 00:16:27.300 || purchases by the country of India India
00:16:29.150 || 00:16:29.160 || notably among the brics Nations that's
00:16:30.550 || 00:16:30.560 || been another theme that you've
00:16:33.470 || 00:16:33.480 || emphasized over the past year plus two
00:16:35.569 || 00:16:35.579 || years with us and it's really gotten the
00:16:37.550 || 00:16:37.560 || attention of many other analysts and
00:16:40.249 || 00:16:40.259 || commentators Etc in the last couple of
00:16:42.249 || 00:16:42.259 || quarters specifically the fourth quarter
00:16:44.629 || 00:16:44.639 || especially what are you looking for in
00:16:47.030 || 00:16:47.040 || 2023 what's the very latest updates that
00:16:48.769 || 00:16:48.779 || you have on the brics phenomenon of
00:16:50.810 || 00:16:50.820 || splitting the world between East versus
00:16:52.910 || 00:16:52.920 || West and the bricks particularly
00:16:54.769 || 00:16:54.779 || focusing on Commodities and metals as
00:16:56.389 || 00:16:56.399 || real wealth
00:16:58.610 || 00:16:58.620 || you know done again I take great pride
00:17:00.590 || 00:17:00.600 || in in
00:17:02.090 || 00:17:02.100 || uh
00:17:03.949 || 00:17:03.959 || the way that we've been talking about
00:17:05.569 || 00:17:05.579 || bricks for the last few years before
00:17:07.130 || 00:17:07.140 || anyone and
00:17:10.610 || 00:17:10.620 || it really dominates my thought process
00:17:13.610 || 00:17:13.620 || so I scour everything I can find to find
00:17:16.130 || 00:17:16.140 || what is new and as I've often spoken to
00:17:18.470 || 00:17:18.480 || you about on your show when you and I
00:17:20.510 || 00:17:20.520 || started talking about bricks in 2020
00:17:22.970 || 00:17:22.980 || there was a piece here and a piece there
00:17:24.770 || 00:17:24.780 || and you know a few weeks later another
00:17:27.829 || 00:17:27.839 || piece and we had to really try and paste
00:17:29.570 || 00:17:29.580 || these things together and what I would
00:17:31.669 || 00:17:31.679 || typically call a linear progression of
00:17:35.029 || 00:17:35.039 || events with you and now it seems that
00:17:37.430 || 00:17:37.440 || you don't even have to look very far to
00:17:39.890 || 00:17:39.900 || see these things starting to really gain
00:17:43.010 || 00:17:43.020 || momentum one of the things that I talked
00:17:44.990 || 00:17:45.000 || about at length
00:17:46.549 || 00:17:46.559 || um over the last few years is the
00:17:48.590 || 00:17:48.600 || weaponizing of the dollar we talked
00:17:51.650 || 00:17:51.660 || about how at least in my mind the
00:17:54.110 || 00:17:54.120 || weaponizing of the dollar against Russia
00:17:57.049 || 00:17:57.059 || kicking them out of Swift Open the Eyes
00:17:59.630 || 00:17:59.640 || of many people around the world other
00:18:01.850 || 00:18:01.860 || countries who said hey you know we need
00:18:03.470 || 00:18:03.480 || to find an alternative to the Swift
00:18:06.650 || 00:18:06.660 || system to the dollar this could be us we
00:18:09.830 || 00:18:09.840 || may be next next on The Hit List and I
00:18:11.990 || 00:18:12.000 || think it's it's very important to hear
00:18:13.430 || 00:18:13.440 || what I'm about to say to you which is
00:18:16.310 || 00:18:16.320 || only going to accentuate and accelerate
00:18:19.310 || 00:18:19.320 || the D dollarization across the globe on
00:18:20.510 || 00:18:20.520 || Friday
00:18:24.169 || 00:18:24.179 || uh uh Russia's Finance Minister
00:18:26.330 || 00:18:26.340 || announced that their National wealth
00:18:29.990 || 00:18:30.000 || fund has doubled their allocation uh up
00:18:32.630 || 00:18:32.640 || to 60 percent of its Holdings in Chinese
00:18:36.110 || 00:18:36.120 || Yuan and up to 40 percent in gold
00:18:38.930 || 00:18:38.940 || bullion to reduce dependency on
00:18:41.870 || 00:18:41.880 || currencies from the so-called unfriendly
00:18:44.270 || 00:18:44.280 || Nations simultaneously the fund reduced
00:18:46.370 || 00:18:46.380 || its Holdings of the British pound and
00:18:49.430 || 00:18:49.440 || the Japanese yen to zero historically
00:18:51.169 || 00:18:51.179 || the fund has been a holder of dollars
00:18:55.190 || 00:18:55.200 || yens euros dollars yen euros and great
00:18:58.610 || 00:18:58.620 || uh Great Britain pounds that's not the
00:19:00.890 || 00:19:00.900 || case anymore currently it's been
00:19:03.289 || 00:19:03.299 || estimated that China China
00:19:05.270 || 00:19:05.280 || we we've talked at length about how
00:19:07.310 || 00:19:07.320 || they've been stockpiling Commodities but
00:19:10.070 || 00:19:10.080 || it is estimated that since 2019 China
00:19:11.690 || 00:19:11.700 || now holds 80 percent of the global
00:19:14.450 || 00:19:14.460 || copper inventories 70 of the Corn
00:19:18.830 || 00:19:18.840 || inventories 51 of the wheat 46 of the
00:19:21.770 || 00:19:21.780 || soybeans 70 of the crude oil and now
00:19:24.010 || 00:19:24.020 || over 20 percent of the aluminum
00:19:26.150 || 00:19:26.160 || inventories and now China is
00:19:28.610 || 00:19:28.620 || aggressively stockpiling just about
00:19:32.810 || 00:19:32.820 || every ounce of gold it can get and you
00:19:35.870 || 00:19:35.880 || know they're also striking relationships
00:19:37.610 || 00:19:37.620 || as we've talked about with all of these
00:19:39.529 || 00:19:39.539 || countries in Africa and South America
00:19:42.590 || 00:19:42.600 || but they are doing it in what is more of
00:19:44.870 || 00:19:44.880 || a Cooperative
00:19:47.750 || 00:19:47.760 || um event it is not about protecting the
00:19:50.810 || 00:19:50.820 || Saudi Kingdom it is about
00:19:53.529 || 00:19:53.539 || um equity and respect and more important
00:19:58.850 || 00:19:58.860 || China has offered uh cooperation in in
00:20:02.230 || 00:20:02.240 || building things Downstream in building
00:20:06.470 || 00:20:06.480 || infrastructure structure to help build
00:20:08.750 || 00:20:08.760 || up these countries in exchange for trade
00:20:11.570 || 00:20:11.580 || in those Commodities but one of the
00:20:15.529 || 00:20:15.539 || reasons that I think that this is really
00:20:20.570 || 00:20:20.580 || a big problem is going back to the
00:20:23.750 || 00:20:23.760 || weaponizing of the dollar this is this
00:20:26.270 || 00:20:26.280 || is a huge problem because it was just it
00:20:29.390 || 00:20:29.400 || was just just the other day in fact it
00:20:32.270 || 00:20:32.280 || was I think last Friday that the
00:20:36.250 || 00:20:36.260 || European Union moved to legitimize
00:20:41.330 || 00:20:41.340 || using the Frozen funds of Russia to
00:20:44.450 || 00:20:44.460 || rebuild the Ukraine in fact they have
00:20:47.810 || 00:20:47.820 || decided to accomplish to to use the
00:20:50.029 || 00:20:50.039 || confiscated funds
00:20:52.250 || 00:20:52.260 || um to finance the the complete and
00:20:55.610 || 00:20:55.620 || costly reconstruction of the of of the
00:20:58.370 || 00:20:58.380 || Ukraine so it's one thing to sanction
00:21:00.110 || 00:21:00.120 || and freeze it's another thing to
00:21:03.529 || 00:21:03.539 || completely and totally confiscate those
00:21:06.289 || 00:21:06.299 || funds and so you are seeing a massive
00:21:08.750 || 00:21:08.760 || devolorization one other thing that I'd
00:21:11.390 || 00:21:11.400 || like to mention regarding what's going
00:21:15.049 || 00:21:15.059 || on with the brics Nations so Russia Iran
00:21:18.169 || 00:21:18.179 || and event Venezuela account for 40
00:21:20.029 || 00:21:20.039 || percent of the world's proven oil
00:21:22.370 || 00:21:22.380 || reserves and each of them are currently
00:21:25.490 || 00:21:25.500 || selling their oil to China right now for
00:21:28.310 || 00:21:28.320 || the renimbi or for the Petro yuan in
00:21:30.049 || 00:21:30.059 || both cases they are both convertible
00:21:31.970 || 00:21:31.980 || into gold and the Shanghai gold exchange
00:21:34.610 || 00:21:34.620 || the
00:21:36.289 || 00:21:36.299 || um the
00:21:39.230 || 00:21:39.240 || other countries for example the Gulf
00:21:42.070 || 00:21:42.080 || Coast countries like Saudi Arabia
00:21:44.029 || 00:21:44.039 || account for
00:21:46.970 || 00:21:46.980 || 40 percent of The Proven oil reserves
00:21:49.730 || 00:21:49.740 || and we know that Saudi Arabia and and
00:21:51.890 || 00:21:51.900 || other countries in the Gulf States are
00:21:54.169 || 00:21:54.179 || selling uh their oil and are being
00:21:56.750 || 00:21:56.760 || courted by China to sell their oil
00:22:00.409 || 00:22:00.419 || foreign bond
00:22:04.370 || 00:22:04.380 || but there's also the remaining 20 of the
00:22:07.130 || 00:22:07.140 || proven oil reserves and in North Africa
00:22:11.029 || 00:22:11.039 || and West Africa and in Indonesia uh
00:22:13.549 || 00:22:13.559 || North Africa is dominated by Russia West
00:22:16.370 || 00:22:16.380 || Africa is now being dominated by China
00:22:19.370 || 00:22:19.380 || but Indonesia has a mind of their own
00:22:21.169 || 00:22:21.179 || and here's a new one that I haven't
00:22:23.750 || 00:22:23.760 || heard of until just recently we can add
00:22:26.930 || 00:22:26.940 || this to the list of uh-oh problems
00:22:30.169 || 00:22:30.179 || Indonesia uh has just and they've been a
00:22:34.850 || 00:22:34.860 || a OPEC member since 1962 has just called
00:22:38.330 || 00:22:38.340 || amongst all of the OPEC countries uh for
00:22:41.090 || 00:22:41.100 || an OPEC style cartel for battery Metals
00:22:45.169 || 00:22:45.179 || uh for electric vehicles and um you know
00:22:47.990 || 00:22:48.000 || all I can say is yikes because when you
00:22:49.909 || 00:22:49.919 || realize that the majority of all the
00:22:53.090 || 00:22:53.100 || rare earth metals come from places like
00:22:56.570 || 00:22:56.580 || China uh we're moving away from fossil
00:23:00.669 || 00:23:00.679 || fuels and to uh a battery-powered
00:23:04.370 || 00:23:04.380 || environment where the majority of all of
00:23:08.029 || 00:23:08.039 || The Proven supplies and resources for
00:23:09.830 || 00:23:09.840 || battery-powered vehicles are in places
00:23:12.230 || 00:23:12.240 || like Indonesia and China who are now
00:23:14.990 || 00:23:15.000 || calling for a cartel if you will very
00:23:17.210 || 00:23:17.220 || similar to OPEC and all of these
00:23:19.070 || 00:23:19.080 || countries who are on the Belt Road
00:23:20.750 || 00:23:20.760 || initiative part of the Shanghai
00:23:23.330 || 00:23:23.340 || cooperation organization and on the
00:23:25.610 || 00:23:25.620 || brics Nations list
00:23:28.130 || 00:23:28.140 || um is is very frightening you were
00:23:29.810 || 00:23:29.820 || beginning to see
00:23:32.330 || 00:23:32.340 || all of the Commodities that are so very
00:23:34.450 || 00:23:34.460 || relevant to the world
00:23:38.630 || 00:23:38.640 || are being accumulated produced and and
00:23:40.549 || 00:23:40.559 || hoarded by the countries that are
00:23:42.289 || 00:23:42.299 || forming this new alliance against the
00:23:44.710 || 00:23:44.720 || West it is starting to speed up
00:23:46.850 || 00:23:46.860 || dramatically so
00:23:49.250 || 00:23:49.260 || what does all of that mean I think what
00:23:52.250 || 00:23:52.260 || it basically means is it's it's
00:23:53.090 || 00:23:53.100 || um
00:23:56.510 || 00:23:56.520 || it's the end of the Petro dollar and it
00:23:58.730 || 00:23:58.740 || is the dawn of the new Petro yawan or
00:24:01.909 || 00:24:01.919 || the brics nations currency and I think
00:24:04.669 || 00:24:04.679 || 2023 will be the year of the bricks I
00:24:07.909 || 00:24:07.919 || truly truly truly believe that it is the
00:24:09.409 || 00:24:09.419 || year of the bricks and when you see
00:24:10.610 || 00:24:10.620 || countries
00:24:13.070 || 00:24:13.080 || sanction and freeze assets but then
00:24:15.110 || 00:24:15.120 || instead of giving them back actually
00:24:19.029 || 00:24:19.039 || confiscate them and use them to repay
00:24:22.130 || 00:24:22.140 || for the rebuilding of of the Ukraine
00:24:23.990 || 00:24:24.000 || that's the nail in the coffin if that
00:24:25.850 || 00:24:25.860 || doesn't accelerate the dead
00:24:27.350 || 00:24:27.360 || dollarization from these countries
00:24:29.149 || 00:24:29.159 || nothing will and and I think we'll start
00:24:31.669 || 00:24:31.679 || to see that very swiftly here early on
00:24:33.950 || 00:24:33.960 || in in 2023
00:24:35.210 || 00:24:35.220 || it's interesting because you're talking
00:24:36.830 || 00:24:36.840 || about so many countries in the world
00:24:39.649 || 00:24:39.659 || pivoting away from the dollar and into
00:24:43.490 || 00:24:43.500 || real things Commodities and metals uh
00:24:45.409 || 00:24:45.419 || it's interesting because even in the
00:24:47.510 || 00:24:47.520 || west where the banks are still trying to
00:24:50.029 || 00:24:50.039 || look like they're holding it together we
00:24:51.890 || 00:24:51.900 || saw a video that came out we're going to
00:24:53.149 || 00:24:53.159 || try to get a link to it to put in the
00:24:54.830 || 00:24:54.840 || description of this in this video is
00:24:58.010 || 00:24:58.020 || description to a meeting at the FDIC
00:25:02.990 || 00:25:03.000 || where an FDIC lead is saying we've got
00:25:05.029 || 00:25:05.039 || problems we've got strains we've got
00:25:07.430 || 00:25:07.440 || risks but we shouldn't let this get out
00:25:08.810 || 00:25:08.820 || to the general public we wouldn't we'd
00:25:10.070 || 00:25:10.080 || want to stop short of letting the
00:25:11.450 || 00:25:11.460 || general public know about that because
00:25:13.190 || 00:25:13.200 || that might undermine confidence in the
00:25:14.690 || 00:25:14.700 || banking system that would be an
00:25:16.490 || 00:25:16.500 || unintended consequence but we do want to
00:25:19.669 || 00:25:19.679 || inform major money managers major fund
00:25:21.770 || 00:25:21.780 || managers uh when that occurs but we
00:25:23.270 || 00:25:23.280 || don't want to be informing the General
00:25:24.169 || 00:25:24.179 || Public
00:25:27.049 || 00:25:27.059 || and just as you keep connecting the dots
00:25:28.730 || 00:25:28.740 || between different phenomena we've talked
00:25:30.950 || 00:25:30.960 || over the past couple of quarters about
00:25:32.870 || 00:25:32.880 || increased challenges that ordinary
00:25:34.970 || 00:25:34.980 || clients and some rather extraordinary
00:25:36.950 || 00:25:36.960 || clients have had trying to get their
00:25:39.890 || 00:25:39.900 || money out of the bank and what can you
00:25:41.870 || 00:25:41.880 || tell us about your perspective or any
00:25:43.970 || 00:25:43.980 || additional insights you have about these
00:25:45.769 || 00:25:45.779 || strains in the banking system that they
00:25:47.450 || 00:25:47.460 || don't want to tell the general public
00:25:48.350 || 00:25:48.360 || about
00:25:50.690 || 00:25:50.700 || well it's very obvious I mean during the
00:25:52.549 || 00:25:52.559 || pandemic the banks were allowed to
00:25:54.710 || 00:25:54.720 || relinquish their reserve requirements
00:25:56.390 || 00:25:56.400 || down to zero now I don't know if that's
00:25:58.250 || 00:25:58.260 || ever come back but it was from a very
00:26:00.110 || 00:26:00.120 || low point to begin with
00:26:03.590 || 00:26:03.600 || under seven or eight percent max so in
00:26:05.690 || 00:26:05.700 || other words the banks hold very little
00:26:08.269 || 00:26:08.279 || in terms of capital and are very over
00:26:11.090 || 00:26:11.100 || leveraged and systemically tied together
00:26:13.370 || 00:26:13.380 || there's no question but that the the
00:26:16.490 || 00:26:16.500 || banks are strained when we did that 50
00:26:20.029 || 00:26:20.039 || million dollar order in July typically a
00:26:21.769 || 00:26:21.779 || sophisticated investor doesn't want
00:26:24.230 || 00:26:24.240 || anyone to know what he or she is doing
00:26:27.289 || 00:26:27.299 || but her whole objective of having us
00:26:30.169 || 00:26:30.179 || tell the public about it was not to tell
00:26:32.029 || 00:26:32.039 || the public that accredited investors
00:26:34.190 || 00:26:34.200 || were were buying large amounts of gold
00:26:37.430 || 00:26:37.440 || and silver but rather that here's an
00:26:39.649 || 00:26:39.659 || investor or an accredited one in a
00:26:41.750 || 00:26:41.760 || sophisticated one who had close to 60
00:26:43.669 || 00:26:43.679 || million dollars in a bank account and it
00:26:45.950 || 00:26:45.960 || took the better part of five days to get
00:26:48.590 || 00:26:48.600 || the money out of the bank and and and
00:26:51.769 || 00:26:51.779 || really culminated at the very end with
00:26:53.990 || 00:26:54.000 || threats that I'm going to The Regulators
00:26:57.110 || 00:26:57.120 || if you don't give me my money and but go
00:26:58.909 || 00:26:58.919 || to the bank and try to take out five
00:27:00.649 || 00:27:00.659 || thousand dollars and they guarantee you
00:27:02.149 || 00:27:02.159 || they ask you what do you plan on doing
00:27:04.610 || 00:27:04.620 || with it the other day I was at the bank
00:27:08.210 || 00:27:08.220 || and a woman asked to have seven thousand
00:27:09.769 || 00:27:09.779 || dollars in cash taken out right in front
00:27:11.930 || 00:27:11.940 || of me an elderly lady and and they said
00:27:13.850 || 00:27:13.860 || I'm sorry it's been during the holidays
00:27:16.310 || 00:27:16.320 || we've had so many people
00:27:18.350 || 00:27:18.360 || um withdraw cash the best I can give you
00:27:19.909 || 00:27:19.919 || is four thousand dollars and I thought
00:27:21.529 || 00:27:21.539 || to myself just how frightening this
00:27:23.990 || 00:27:24.000 || really is I think you have to ask
00:27:26.390 || 00:27:26.400 || yourself the question is
00:27:28.250 || 00:27:28.260 || is the the return that we're getting
00:27:30.529 || 00:27:30.539 || yeah we've seen rates rise but not in
00:27:31.850 || 00:27:31.860 || the savings or checking accounts
00:27:33.769 || 00:27:33.779 || ironically those are still next to
00:27:36.169 || 00:27:36.179 || nothing and is the is the risk that we
00:27:38.630 || 00:27:38.640 || have the systemic risk the bail in Risk
00:27:41.510 || 00:27:41.520 || you know FDIC FDIC as you mentioned well
00:27:43.909 || 00:27:43.919 || they're a scam you look at how much
00:27:47.510 || 00:27:47.520 || money they have in the FDIC Kitty if a
00:27:49.490 || 00:27:49.500 || bank like Wells Fargo or B of A went
00:27:50.870 || 00:27:50.880 || bankrupt they wouldn't have enough even
00:27:52.789 || 00:27:52.799 || to cover that let alone a systemic
00:27:55.010 || 00:27:55.020 || breakdown of the system
00:27:57.470 || 00:27:57.480 || um and look you can take it a step
00:27:59.930 || 00:27:59.940 || further done again take a look at the
00:28:01.490 || 00:28:01.500 || amount of money in the reverse repo
00:28:03.769 || 00:28:03.779 || Market over two trillion dollars the
00:28:06.950 || 00:28:06.960 || reverse repo Market is it's a mechanism
00:28:08.810 || 00:28:08.820 || whereby when the banks have in their
00:28:11.390 || 00:28:11.400 || mind too much money they will give it to
00:28:13.250 || 00:28:13.260 || the Federal Reserve for overnight loans
00:28:16.490 || 00:28:16.500 || so right now it is the idea of the bank
00:28:19.430 || 00:28:19.440 || said hey we would feel safer putting two
00:28:21.350 || 00:28:21.360 || trillion dollars in the reverse repo
00:28:23.930 || 00:28:23.940 || Market safely parked at the FED earning
00:28:25.730 || 00:28:25.740 || three percent then lending it out to you
00:28:27.529 || 00:28:27.539 || or I for a car our loan or home equity
00:28:29.690 || 00:28:29.700 || loan or even a credit card earning many
00:28:32.210 || 00:28:32.220 || times what they are getting was safety
00:28:34.130 || 00:28:34.140 || what they are telling you without saying
00:28:36.350 || 00:28:36.360 || is that they're scared because Banks
00:28:38.690 || 00:28:38.700 || make their money by lending that's how
00:28:40.250 || 00:28:40.260 || Banks make money they make money by
00:28:42.590 || 00:28:42.600 || lending it and making the spread between
00:28:44.870 || 00:28:44.880 || what they're paying for that money and
00:28:47.029 || 00:28:47.039 || what what they're lending it out at when
00:28:48.769 || 00:28:48.779 || the banks would rather give the money to
00:28:51.289 || 00:28:51.299 || the FED in massive quantities
00:28:53.870 || 00:28:53.880 || for leaving huge amounts of profit on
00:28:56.210 || 00:28:56.220 || the table it tells you they are very
00:28:59.149 || 00:28:59.159 || very concerned and it betrays any
00:29:02.210 || 00:29:02.220 || positive rhetoric that you may hear so I
00:29:04.970 || 00:29:04.980 || think when people are are weighing the
00:29:06.890 || 00:29:06.900 || pros and the cons of leaving money in
00:29:08.810 || 00:29:08.820 || the bank you're earning next to nothing
00:29:11.210 || 00:29:11.220 || there are bail in legislations and for
00:29:13.310 || 00:29:13.320 || those people who at this point don't
00:29:14.750 || 00:29:14.760 || know what bail-ins are they really
00:29:17.269 || 00:29:17.279 || should just simply Google bail-ins but
00:29:19.430 || 00:29:19.440 || I'll give you the cliff note version the
00:29:21.889 || 00:29:21.899 || way that it works now done again in with
00:29:23.750 || 00:29:23.760 || bail in legislation the bottom line is
00:29:25.610 || 00:29:25.620 || is that the
00:29:28.490 || 00:29:28.500 || um the the depositor is nothing but a
00:29:31.310 || 00:29:31.320 || general creditor to the bank and and so
00:29:34.010 || 00:29:34.020 || when you talk about the risks involved
00:29:37.490 || 00:29:37.500 || with leaving money in the bank uh the
00:29:40.430 || 00:29:40.440 || systemic nature of all of these Banks
00:29:42.110 || 00:29:42.120 || who are over leveraged and under
00:29:45.470 || 00:29:45.480 || capitalized uh earning in your bank
00:29:49.149 || 00:29:49.159 || account under one percent in most cases
00:29:52.190 || 00:29:52.200 || you have one has to wonder is it worth
00:29:52.970 || 00:29:52.980 || it
00:29:55.130 || 00:29:55.140 || um pulling money out of the bank is like
00:29:58.430 || 00:29:58.440 || pulling teeth and the return that you
00:29:59.690 || 00:29:59.700 || are receiving
00:30:02.029 || 00:30:02.039 || is arguably not commensurate with the
00:30:03.710 || 00:30:03.720 || risk that you are facing for the very
00:30:06.409 || 00:30:06.419 || first time really in my lifetime that I
00:30:08.750 || 00:30:08.760 || can think of where leaving money in the
00:30:11.690 || 00:30:11.700 || bank has a a risk attached to it that
00:30:13.130 || 00:30:13.140 || most people never would have ever
00:30:14.570 || 00:30:14.580 || thought of you think of putting your
00:30:16.730 || 00:30:16.740 || money in the bank as the safe place to
00:30:19.730 || 00:30:19.740 || put it well I could argue digging a hole
00:30:22.010 || 00:30:22.020 || in your backyard and putting it there is
00:30:25.070 || 00:30:25.080 || safer than leaving it in a bank where if
00:30:28.970 || 00:30:28.980 || there is a problem uh you have a real
00:30:31.130 || 00:30:31.140 || problem getting your money out of the
00:30:33.289 || 00:30:33.299 || bank in that instance if they enact
00:30:35.330 || 00:30:35.340 || things like bail in legislation or money
00:30:37.370 || 00:30:37.380 || market gating which we've talked about
00:30:39.710 || 00:30:39.720 || before but it doesn't surprise me at all
00:30:41.570 || 00:30:41.580 || anyone who's tried to pull out over a
00:30:44.029 || 00:30:44.039 || few thousand dollars in cash out of the
00:30:45.830 || 00:30:45.840 || bank will understand exactly what we're
00:30:47.990 || 00:30:48.000 || talking about yeah and there seems to be
00:30:50.450 || 00:30:50.460 || even special attention being paid to
00:30:52.370 || 00:30:52.380 || people who are sending Bank wires to pay
00:30:55.090 || 00:30:55.100 || for gold and silver purchases we've had
00:30:57.889 || 00:30:57.899 || them getting some fairly intrusive
00:30:59.630 || 00:30:59.640 || questioning from the banks and some of
00:31:01.389 || 00:31:01.399 || our
00:31:03.950 || 00:31:03.960 || subscribers who are associated with or
00:31:05.389 || 00:31:05.399 || have experience in the banking system
00:31:07.430 || 00:31:07.440 || say hey they've got fiduciary
00:31:09.230 || 00:31:09.240 || responsibilities you know similar to
00:31:11.269 || 00:31:11.279 || that what we have in our anti-money
00:31:13.310 || 00:31:13.320 || laundering and know your client training
00:31:14.690 || 00:31:14.700 || that we go through on an annual basis
00:31:18.230 || 00:31:18.240 || for licensure as bullion dealers they
00:31:20.029 || 00:31:20.039 || have responsibility to make sure that
00:31:22.250 || 00:31:22.260 || their clients are aware or they're not
00:31:24.470 || 00:31:24.480 || they're not they're not being dragged
00:31:26.029 || 00:31:26.039 || into some kind of money laundering or
00:31:28.370 || 00:31:28.380 || something like that by being asked to
00:31:30.470 || 00:31:30.480 || send off cash to some inscript you know
00:31:34.909 || 00:31:34.919 || unscrupletal uh dealer but uh they in
00:31:36.409 || 00:31:36.419 || some cases it sounds like the level of
00:31:38.870 || 00:31:38.880 || questioning has become uh kind of over
00:31:41.870 || 00:31:41.880 || the top and it's it's hard not to wonder
00:31:45.169 || 00:31:45.179 || if there's also in the in the color of
00:31:47.450 || 00:31:47.460 || we're protecting our clients we're also
00:31:49.789 || 00:31:49.799 || just like Jed Clampett he had his money
00:31:52.850 || 00:31:52.860 || in the bank there in Hollywood uh in the
00:31:55.490 || 00:31:55.500 || and the banker always broke a big sweat
00:31:57.049 || 00:31:57.059 || when whenever Jed said maybe I should
00:31:58.490 || 00:31:58.500 || take my money out of the bank oh no no
00:32:00.230 || 00:32:00.240 || Mr Clampett oh no no
00:32:02.149 || 00:32:02.159 || so anyway it sounds like maybe a little
00:32:04.250 || 00:32:04.260 || bit of self-serving concerned and I
00:32:05.810 || 00:32:05.820 || think there's no question but that the
00:32:07.490 || 00:32:07.500 || banks are reluctant to let money out
00:32:10.269 || 00:32:10.279 || whether it be trying to take a a cash
00:32:12.830 || 00:32:12.840 || withdrawal of five thousand dollars or
00:32:16.310 || 00:32:16.320 || or a wire to purchase precious metals
00:32:18.110 || 00:32:18.120 || for fifty thousand dollars or anything
00:32:20.269 || 00:32:20.279 || in between or on either side of it
00:32:23.630 || 00:32:23.640 || there's no question but that the banks
00:32:26.210 || 00:32:26.220 || are concerned and probably have been
00:32:29.149 || 00:32:29.159 || alerted to it and um it doesn't surprise
00:32:31.430 || 00:32:31.440 || me one bit
00:32:33.889 || 00:32:33.899 || um the more people that pull their money
00:32:35.690 || 00:32:35.700 || out of the banks the greater the
00:32:37.610 || 00:32:37.620 || instability these banks will have and
00:32:40.250 || 00:32:40.260 || what starts as a trickle can turn into a
00:32:43.430 || 00:32:43.440 || flood very very quickly so when you see
00:32:47.230 || 00:32:47.240 || FDIC coming and making these Admissions
00:32:50.029 || 00:32:50.039 || and it leaks out that they don't want
00:32:52.549 || 00:32:52.559 || the public to know about it putting it
00:32:54.590 || 00:32:54.600 || together with how difficult it is to get
00:32:56.210 || 00:32:56.220 || your money out of the bank whether it be
00:32:58.850 || 00:32:58.860 || a wire or just a cash withdrawal it all
00:33:01.490 || 00:33:01.500 || starts to make perfect make sense so
00:33:04.070 || 00:33:04.080 || yeah I think people should certainly be
00:33:06.289 || 00:33:06.299 || aware of these types of challenges and
00:33:08.570 || 00:33:08.580 || this is just another reason to mitigate
00:33:10.909 || 00:33:10.919 || your exposure to a to an over leveraged
00:33:12.710 || 00:33:12.720 || under capitalized
00:33:16.669 || 00:33:16.679 || invasive banking system that um you know
00:33:19.130 || 00:33:19.140 || the return is not commensurate with the
00:33:22.250 || 00:33:22.260 || risk that you're facing whatsoever
00:33:25.250 || 00:33:25.260 || in the face of that many people who are
00:33:27.830 || 00:33:27.840 || waking up are deciding to lower their
00:33:29.690 || 00:33:29.700 || exposure to potential banking system
00:33:31.370 || 00:33:31.380 || Risk by
00:33:33.470 || 00:33:33.480 || acquiring real assets paying off debts
00:33:35.750 || 00:33:35.760 || doing all kinds of prudent things that
00:33:37.190 || 00:33:37.200 || our grandparents always told us we
00:33:40.850 || 00:33:40.860 || should do and you have a way of helping
00:33:43.370 || 00:33:43.380 || people along that way by offering a
00:33:45.950 || 00:33:45.960 || special of a particular value each week
00:33:47.990 || 00:33:48.000 || could you clue Us in on what's available
00:33:49.669 || 00:33:49.679 || in the coming week here so people can
00:33:51.470 || 00:33:51.480 || jump on that opportunity
00:33:53.330 || 00:33:53.340 || yeah we're going to continue on the
00:33:55.009 || 00:33:55.019 || silver bandwagon
00:33:55.730 || 00:33:55.740 || um
00:33:58.009 || 00:33:58.019 || ultimately done again I believe the
00:33:59.990 || 00:34:00.000 || place to be is cool and we've talked a
00:34:01.430 || 00:34:01.440 || lot about this
00:34:03.590 || 00:34:03.600 || as gold was reclassified the world's
00:34:05.690 || 00:34:05.700 || only other tier one Reserve asset in
00:34:08.329 || 00:34:08.339 || 2019 and and it certainly underscores
00:34:11.030 || 00:34:11.040 || why the banks have been so voraciously
00:34:13.310 || 00:34:13.320 || accumulating it but we're also seeing
00:34:17.030 || 00:34:17.040 || central banks now accumulate silver and
00:34:19.730 || 00:34:19.740 || I think silver to me represents the most
00:34:22.849 || 00:34:22.859 || undervalued asset on the planet and a
00:34:25.190 || 00:34:25.200 || pathway into achieving more gold to
00:34:27.169 || 00:34:27.179 || accumulating more gold as we talked
00:34:29.690 || 00:34:29.700 || about whenever the ratio gold to Silver
00:34:33.829 || 00:34:33.839 || hits 92-1 the four times since 2000 has
00:34:38.570 || 00:34:38.580 || embarked Upon A a massive change where
00:34:42.230 || 00:34:42.240 || it it inverts and gets closer to its 200
00:34:45.649 || 00:34:45.659 || year average of roughly 42-1
00:34:48.310 || 00:34:48.320 || bottom line is this there are very few
00:34:51.169 || 00:34:51.179 || assets on the planet that have the type
00:34:54.050 || 00:34:54.060 || of potential that we see in silver you
00:34:56.810 || 00:34:56.820 || know we talk about how silver is used up
00:34:59.089 || 00:34:59.099 || in Industry look at all the tomahawk
00:35:01.910 || 00:35:01.920 || cruise missiles that have been uh fired
00:35:04.250 || 00:35:04.260 || off in the Ukraine those that you know
00:35:06.770 || 00:35:06.780 || that that all of them have roughly a
00:35:09.109 || 00:35:09.119 || mint box of silver in the tip 500 ounce
00:35:11.690 || 00:35:11.700 || it's almost to the ounce in the in the
00:35:14.569 || 00:35:14.579 || guidance system of every military-grade
00:35:17.390 || 00:35:17.400 || missile and so when you talk about the
00:35:19.490 || 00:35:19.500 || depletion of silver that's just another
00:35:22.370 || 00:35:22.380 || area where once they fire that missile
00:35:25.010 || 00:35:25.020 || the silver is gone forever and this is
00:35:27.230 || 00:35:27.240 || an asset that is depleting in nature but
00:35:29.329 || 00:35:29.339 || is being drained down by the biggest
00:35:31.069 || 00:35:31.079 || most sophisticated money in the world
00:35:33.829 || 00:35:33.839 || from the exchanges what is ironic about
00:35:36.530 || 00:35:36.540 || all of this is that never in my career
00:35:39.589 || 00:35:39.599 || and I asked a veteran of of 50 years in
00:35:40.910 || 00:35:40.920 || this industry I've been doing this for
00:35:43.609 || 00:35:43.619 || 33. have you ever seen a period of time
00:35:45.589 || 00:35:45.599 || where premiums have come down
00:35:48.230 || 00:35:48.240 || the way they have over the last month
00:35:50.390 || 00:35:50.400 || month and a half he says not even close
00:35:52.430 || 00:35:52.440 || and it caught everyone off guard and I
00:35:55.490 || 00:35:55.500 || want people to understand that that the
00:35:57.050 || 00:35:57.060 || current special that we are selling
00:35:59.030 || 00:35:59.040 || right now the Australian kangaroo is one
00:36:01.730 || 00:36:01.740 || of two items that we are special and we
00:36:03.589 || 00:36:03.599 || paid more for than we're selling them
00:36:05.150 || 00:36:05.160 || for and I know people have a hard time
00:36:07.250 || 00:36:07.260 || believing that we had a very good year
00:36:09.410 || 00:36:09.420 || and we made it we make a good living in
00:36:11.450 || 00:36:11.460 || this industry but there's a lot of risk
00:36:13.069 || 00:36:13.079 || involved with it and this is a perfect
00:36:15.650 || 00:36:15.660 || example in order to keep Supply coming
00:36:19.130 || 00:36:19.140 || in since 2020 we have had to go anywhere
00:36:22.370 || 00:36:22.380 || from 8 to 16 weeks out and commit and
00:36:24.710 || 00:36:24.720 || pay up front and hedge and run Logistics
00:36:26.270 || 00:36:26.280 || on products from all around the world
00:36:28.430 || 00:36:28.440 || there was no exception in these
00:36:31.130 || 00:36:31.140 || kangaroos which were purchased as 2022s
00:36:33.530 || 00:36:33.540 || in October and when we purchased those
00:36:36.349 || 00:36:36.359 || October November the premiums were much
00:36:39.290 || 00:36:39.300 || higher and now the premiums that we're
00:36:41.210 || 00:36:41.220 || selling them for because of the slowdown
00:36:42.950 || 00:36:42.960 || in the industry coupled with the new
00:36:45.589 || 00:36:45.599 || allocations of 2023s
00:36:48.010 || 00:36:48.020 || see an industry that has literally
00:36:50.990 || 00:36:51.000 || cratered premiums now I don't think this
00:36:53.329 || 00:36:53.339 || is anything substantive or long lasting
00:36:55.490 || 00:36:55.500 || but I do want people to understand that
00:36:58.069 || 00:36:58.079 || we share in the risk we definitely share
00:37:00.530 || 00:37:00.540 || in the risk with everyone because here
00:37:02.510 || 00:37:02.520 || we have millions of dollars worth of
00:37:05.390 || 00:37:05.400 || silver kangaroos that we paid as much as
00:37:08.450 || 00:37:08.460 || two dollars an ounce more for just in
00:37:11.150 || 00:37:11.160 || the premium that we are selling them to
00:37:14.150 || 00:37:14.160 || the public for now so in any case we
00:37:16.310 || 00:37:16.320 || have the 2022
00:37:18.650 || 00:37:18.660 || silver kangaroo and the assorted back
00:37:22.670 || 00:37:22.680 || date Silver Maple Leafs and uh at the
00:37:24.349 || 00:37:24.359 || premium that we're selling them for at
00:37:26.329 || 00:37:26.339 || four dollars and 19 cents over the price
00:37:28.010 || 00:37:28.020 || of silver that's as low as we've sold
00:37:31.849 || 00:37:31.859 || them for literally since 2019. it's as
00:37:34.069 || 00:37:34.079 || good of a buy as you will ever find I
00:37:36.829 || 00:37:36.839 || think at least at as good of a buy as
00:37:38.870 || 00:37:38.880 || we've seen in the better part of three
00:37:41.870 || 00:37:41.880 || years and when we look at Silver as
00:37:44.450 || 00:37:44.460 || being the most undervalued asset in the
00:37:47.630 || 00:37:47.640 || world remember it's a pathway into
00:37:49.910 || 00:37:49.920 || accumulating a whole lot more gold when
00:37:52.190 || 00:37:52.200 || that ratio finally corrects and the way
00:37:54.109 || 00:37:54.119 || that it has the four times preceding
00:37:57.290 || 00:37:57.300 || since the year 2000 tells me that there
00:37:58.790 || 00:37:58.800 || will come a time in the near future
00:38:01.370 || 00:38:01.380 || where we see a ratio of 40 to one or
00:38:03.710 || 00:38:03.720 || better maybe it even gets closer to its
00:38:06.470 || 00:38:06.480 || geologic ratio single digits but
00:38:08.569 || 00:38:08.579 || whatever it may be when you're buying it
00:38:11.030 || 00:38:11.040 || near 80 to one and the ratio for 200
00:38:13.609 || 00:38:13.619 || years is average 40 to one it gives you
00:38:16.190 || 00:38:16.200 || the ability to buy silver now wait for
00:38:18.530 || 00:38:18.540 || that that ratio to come back to correct
00:38:22.130 || 00:38:22.140 || to revision to the mean and then convert
00:38:26.089 || 00:38:26.099 || into gold that is the ultimate plan and
00:38:29.530 || 00:38:29.540 || um as I mentioned at the onset sometimes
00:38:34.490 || 00:38:34.500 || these revisions or or uh regression to
00:38:36.770 || 00:38:36.780 || the mean happens in a period of a few
00:38:39.410 || 00:38:39.420 || months like it did in 2010 and 2011 in
00:38:41.089 || 00:38:41.099 || seven months sometimes it takes a few
00:38:44.030 || 00:38:44.040 || years like it seems to be taking this
00:38:46.849 || 00:38:46.859 || time have some patience
00:38:48.410 || 00:38:48.420 || um because I think this will be the
00:38:52.910 || 00:38:52.920 || trait of of of a generation this is in
00:38:55.430 || 00:38:55.440 || my opinion the buying opportunity of a
00:38:57.829 || 00:38:57.839 || generation the value of a generation an
00:39:00.290 || 00:39:00.300 || asset that is so massively needed in so
00:39:03.950 || 00:39:03.960 || many ways and so on they're valued by so
00:39:06.109 || 00:39:06.119 || many metrics there are very few things
00:39:08.450 || 00:39:08.460 || that I've ever seen in my life that
00:39:11.750 || 00:39:11.760 || offer this type of of of potential and
00:39:14.089 || 00:39:14.099 || that's never the reason that I offer or
00:39:17.390 || 00:39:17.400 || or recommend people by metals it's not
00:39:20.870 || 00:39:20.880 || an investment to me as well but this is
00:39:22.910 || 00:39:22.920 || has all the characteristics of one hell
00:39:24.589 || 00:39:24.599 || of an investment so we're sticking with
00:39:26.930 || 00:39:26.940 || silver right now and they do the 2022
00:39:28.790 || 00:39:28.800 || Kangaroos and the assorted back date
00:39:31.910 || 00:39:31.920 || Maple Leaves both for 419 over both in
00:39:33.829 || 00:39:33.839 || stock both ready for immediate delivery
00:39:36.109 || 00:39:36.119 || well Andy we're always grateful for that
00:39:39.170 || 00:39:39.180 || and uh I've seen already in this first
00:39:42.589 || 00:39:42.599 || day of two of January a dramatic uptick
00:39:45.230 || 00:39:45.240 || in the amount of client activities so it
00:39:47.150 || 00:39:47.160 || seems like that people taking
00:39:49.490 || 00:39:49.500 || the last part of the year off for a time
00:39:52.250 || 00:39:52.260 || with a family and holiday and church and
00:39:54.349 || 00:39:54.359 || so on uh seems to be playing out as it
00:39:55.910 || 00:39:55.920 || has in the past and now people are back
