00:01:08.149 || 00:01:08.159 || deflation what does that have to do with
00:01:10.370 || 00:01:10.380 || Gold's performance historically are we
00:01:11.870 || 00:01:11.880 || really in a bull market for gold was
00:01:14.210 || 00:01:14.220 || this just a fake uh jump last week in
00:01:15.590 || 00:01:15.600 || silver and now it's down a little bit
00:01:18.109 || 00:01:18.119 || today uh any question is a good one I
00:01:19.670 || 00:01:19.680 || just put the question out there in the
00:01:22.730 || 00:01:22.740 || title of this video of of where should I
00:01:23.990 || 00:01:24.000 || store my gold because that's a question
00:01:26.030 || 00:01:26.040 || we're getting a lot from clients when
00:01:27.770 || 00:01:27.780 || they call in but your questions are the
00:01:29.929 || 00:01:29.939 || ones we care about tonight so ask any
00:01:31.249 || 00:01:31.259 || question you want in the live stream and
00:01:32.810 || 00:01:32.820 || I'll try to get those in front of Andy
00:01:34.789 || 00:01:34.799 || but Andy let's kick that one off since
00:01:37.670 || 00:01:37.680 || it's been kind of uh a lively discussion
00:01:38.749 || 00:01:38.759 || we've been having already for the past
00:01:40.910 || 00:01:40.920 || half hour or so in the live chat uh
00:01:42.950 || 00:01:42.960 || there are certainly a vocal chorus of
00:01:44.330 || 00:01:44.340 || voices there that are saying if you
00:01:46.730 || 00:01:46.740 || don't hold it you don't own it and I
00:01:49.130 || 00:01:49.140 || know that that's a very important aspect
00:01:50.990 || 00:01:51.000 || of everything that you've thought of
00:01:53.270 || 00:01:53.280 || through your life is privacy personal
00:01:55.730 || 00:01:55.740 || freedom that kind of thing so maybe you
00:01:57.109 || 00:01:57.119 || can share just a bit of your personal
00:02:00.109 || 00:02:00.119 || philosophy about storing of gold and
00:02:01.490 || 00:02:01.500 || does it matter whether you're just
00:02:04.490 || 00:02:04.500 || beginning or eventually if you have
00:02:07.730 || 00:02:07.740 || amassed quite a significant stack does
00:02:10.249 || 00:02:10.259 || that change the equation at all and does
00:02:12.410 || 00:02:12.420 || it also matter whether you live you know
00:02:13.550 || 00:02:13.560 || out in the country you've got plenty of
00:02:16.070 || 00:02:16.080 || acreage and a big house and whatever
00:02:17.690 || 00:02:17.700 || security system that sort of thing
00:02:20.030 || 00:02:20.040 || versus if you live in a crowded uh
00:02:22.309 || 00:02:22.319 || apartment in a city
00:02:23.869 || 00:02:23.879 || um does that change the the game for you
00:02:25.670 || 00:02:25.680 || in the equation as well um your thoughts
00:02:27.350 || 00:02:27.360 || you know look they're extenuating
00:02:30.770 || 00:02:30.780 || circumstances in in every instance in
00:02:33.470 || 00:02:33.480 || every case every case is different you
00:02:35.990 || 00:02:36.000 || know to to the point of of most people
00:02:38.210 || 00:02:38.220 || my friend Vicks Weir talks about this
00:02:41.449 || 00:02:41.459 || the most if you don't hold it you don't
00:02:43.850 || 00:02:43.860 || own it there is a certain amount of
00:02:46.009 || 00:02:46.019 || Truth to that a certain amount in the
00:02:49.610 || 00:02:49.620 || respect that uh you know we all often
00:02:51.890 || 00:02:51.900 || talk about Metals being gold and silver
00:02:54.830 || 00:02:54.840 || being assets that are not simultaneously
00:02:57.170 || 00:02:57.180 || someone else's liability you have the
00:02:59.509 || 00:02:59.519 || complete absence of removal of
00:03:02.390 || 00:03:02.400 || counterparty risk I mean I think the
00:03:03.949 || 00:03:03.959 || truth is people have a greater
00:03:05.690 || 00:03:05.700 || likelihood of being ripped off by the
00:03:08.930 || 00:03:08.940 || system than they do by a burglar uh
00:03:11.210 || 00:03:11.220 || looking for precious metals I think that
00:03:15.290 || 00:03:15.300 || one of the drawbacks of owning medals is
00:03:17.750 || 00:03:17.760 || the urge to help other people and talk
00:03:20.030 || 00:03:20.040 || about it uh if you're gonna hold it at
00:03:22.070 || 00:03:22.080 || home you need to keep it quiet um you
00:03:23.630 || 00:03:23.640 || don't want to tell everyone about it
00:03:26.089 || 00:03:26.099 || it's Noble to want to help your friends
00:03:28.009 || 00:03:28.019 || and family to show them what it is that
00:03:30.410 || 00:03:30.420 || you purchase but yeah if you are
00:03:33.350 || 00:03:33.360 || concerned about loose lips sinking ships
00:03:35.030 || 00:03:35.040 || certainly you want to hold it at home
00:03:37.130 || 00:03:37.140 || and tell your immediate family or your
00:03:38.809 || 00:03:38.819 || loved ones and then do a damn good job
00:03:41.390 || 00:03:41.400 || of hiding it you don't always need to
00:03:43.610 || 00:03:43.620 || put it in a safe you could put it in an
00:03:46.250 || 00:03:46.260 || empty paint can and splash paint on the
00:03:49.550 || 00:03:49.560 || outside of it and throw your coins in in
00:03:51.350 || 00:03:51.360 || the closet or the basement with your
00:03:53.330 || 00:03:53.340 || other half empty paint cans you could
00:03:57.110 || 00:03:57.120 || get a big potted plant and lift up the
00:03:58.729 || 00:03:58.739 || plant and fill the bottom with gold and
00:04:01.610 || 00:04:01.620 || silver put the plant back down and you
00:04:04.190 || 00:04:04.200 || could bury it to feed underground if you
00:04:06.710 || 00:04:06.720 || buried it in a PVC pipe cap with rubber
00:04:09.170 || 00:04:09.180 || caps on the end vertically not
00:04:11.089 || 00:04:11.099 || horizontally vertically two feet down
00:04:15.649 || 00:04:15.659 || there isn't but a a a metal detector on
00:04:18.409 || 00:04:18.419 || the planet that will find it very easily
00:04:21.650 || 00:04:21.660 || you can be very creative in hiding your
00:04:23.629 || 00:04:23.639 || precious metals you can hide some in a
00:04:27.290 || 00:04:27.300 || safe uh and and call that your decal
00:04:30.890 || 00:04:30.900 || your decoy safe uh say if that has just
00:04:32.570 || 00:04:32.580 || enough in it to
00:04:35.990 || 00:04:36.000 || um pacify a would-be burglar Intruder
00:04:38.450 || 00:04:38.460 || and a small safe or several small saves
00:04:40.610 || 00:04:40.620 || hidden throughout the house that are
00:04:43.249 || 00:04:43.259 || filled with with gold and cash
00:04:45.950 || 00:04:45.960 || um you can get a little safe that you
00:04:48.050 || 00:04:48.060 || know about yay big that you buy it in a
00:04:50.870 || 00:04:50.880 || handgun store uh bedside safe for for
00:04:53.270 || 00:04:53.280 || handguns but they typically have a bolt
00:04:55.310 || 00:04:55.320 || in the back of them and you can fasten
00:04:58.310 || 00:04:58.320 || that to a stud behind uh even behind
00:04:59.930 || 00:04:59.940 || sheetrock if you really want to get
00:05:03.890 || 00:05:03.900 || creative and you know I think holding it
00:05:05.990 || 00:05:06.000 || taking possession of it does have
00:05:07.969 || 00:05:07.979 || logistic issues it does have security
00:05:09.890 || 00:05:09.900 || issues but if you're creative enough
00:05:12.770 || 00:05:12.780 || certainly you are able to hide it and
00:05:14.270 || 00:05:14.280 || keep it quiet
00:05:16.610 || 00:05:16.620 || um and I think that's typically going to
00:05:18.350 || 00:05:18.360 || be your best approach now with that
00:05:21.050 || 00:05:21.060 || being said I'm very proud of our storage
00:05:22.969 || 00:05:22.979 || program with Brinks I believe we have
00:05:24.590 || 00:05:24.600 || the finest storage program in the
00:05:26.510 || 00:05:26.520 || industry and for some people
00:05:28.850 || 00:05:28.860 || you know whether it be living in a in a
00:05:32.390 || 00:05:32.400 || very dense uh uh you know City type
00:05:34.370 || 00:05:34.380 || atmosphere like in New York City in
00:05:36.590 || 00:05:36.600 || Manhattan I just visited my son in
00:05:38.689 || 00:05:38.699 || Manhattan he has two roommates the
00:05:40.610 || 00:05:40.620 || apartment is almost eight thousand
00:05:43.249 || 00:05:43.259 || dollars a month and it's the size of a
00:05:46.070 || 00:05:46.080 || of a shoebox I mean it's unbelievable so
00:05:50.990 || 00:05:51.000 || you know people who are living in a uh
00:05:52.969 || 00:05:52.979 || in a place like that well they may have
00:05:54.890 || 00:05:54.900 || issues of being able not only with
00:05:56.870 || 00:05:56.880 || roommates but living in an apartment
00:05:59.689 || 00:05:59.699 || where it's so crowded
00:06:02.510 || 00:06:02.520 || um uh all the way around you that that
00:06:04.790 || 00:06:04.800 || can become an issue and and for some
00:06:06.770 || 00:06:06.780 || people whether it be something like that
00:06:09.469 || 00:06:09.479 || or just accumulating so much that it
00:06:12.409 || 00:06:12.419 || begins to wear on you and compromise
00:06:14.210 || 00:06:14.220 || your peace of mind and sleep at night
00:06:16.070 || 00:06:16.080 || and then again the most important asset
00:06:18.290 || 00:06:18.300 || you can own is peace of mind is sleep at
00:06:20.930 || 00:06:20.940 || night it's feeling good about things and
00:06:24.050 || 00:06:24.060 || not worrying that you're a victim
00:06:25.850 || 00:06:25.860 || waiting to happen
00:06:26.450 || 00:06:26.460 || um
00:06:29.210 || 00:06:29.220 || and if that is ever the feeling uh
00:06:30.710 || 00:06:30.720 || certainly
00:06:34.309 || 00:06:34.319 || um putting your um your your metal into
00:06:36.830 || 00:06:36.840 || storage is a good alternative and if you
00:06:40.670 || 00:06:40.680 || do that if you do choose storage you
00:06:42.890 || 00:06:42.900 || want to store it somewhere where it is
00:06:45.890 || 00:06:45.900 || segregated not allocated allocated the
00:06:47.090 || 00:06:47.100 || difference between allocated and
00:06:48.830 || 00:06:48.840 || segregated is that allocated means
00:06:53.150 || 00:06:53.160 || allocated to uh to a program or to a
00:06:56.270 || 00:06:56.280 || company or to an IRA or when you talk
00:06:58.129 || 00:06:58.139 || about allocation it means it's it's
00:07:00.770 || 00:07:00.780 || lumped together to me it's pooled when
00:07:03.050 || 00:07:03.060 || you talk segregated that's in in
00:07:05.450 || 00:07:05.460 || dunnigan's name in Andy's name and
00:07:07.249 || 00:07:07.259 || that's what you want so if you're going
00:07:09.950 || 00:07:09.960 || to choose to store it somewhere don't
00:07:11.930 || 00:07:11.940 || ever be Pennywise in Palm foolish
00:07:13.850 || 00:07:13.860 || choosing allocation over segregation
00:07:16.309 || 00:07:16.319 || make sure it is allocated and segregated
00:07:18.710 || 00:07:18.720 || and really this will come into play most
00:07:21.110 || 00:07:21.120 || of the time with IRAs where some
00:07:24.110 || 00:07:24.120 || custodians will allocate the metal and
00:07:25.730 || 00:07:25.740 || others will segregate the metal
00:07:27.710 || 00:07:27.720 || segregation is really what you're
00:07:30.290 || 00:07:30.300 || looking for so whether it's a a personal
00:07:35.450 || 00:07:35.460 || account or an IRA you want to choose a
00:07:39.110 || 00:07:39.120 || a company that has a very sound balance
00:07:42.290 || 00:07:42.300 || sheet I have partnered with breaks
00:07:44.990 || 00:07:45.000 || across the board because they're a
00:07:46.610 || 00:07:46.620 || Fortune 100 company they've been around
00:07:49.309 || 00:07:49.319 || for a hundred years they're they're as
00:07:52.790 || 00:07:52.800 || solid and stable as it gets and I also
00:07:54.950 || 00:07:54.960 || think that if you're storing you buy
00:07:56.629 || 00:07:56.639 || metal there are certain companies out
00:07:58.309 || 00:07:58.319 || there and they're good retail companies
00:07:59.749 || 00:07:59.759 || I don't have anything negative to say
00:08:02.029 || 00:08:02.039 || about any of the companies who offer
00:08:04.189 || 00:08:04.199 || storage on premises they're good
00:08:07.249 || 00:08:07.259 || companies but as a rule of thumb
00:08:09.529 || 00:08:09.539 || um bullion direct is a good example this
00:08:11.330 || 00:08:11.340 || was a company that beat everyone and
00:08:14.089 || 00:08:14.099 || price online everyone asked me similar
00:08:15.830 || 00:08:15.840 || to tolving and Northwest Territorial
00:08:17.510 || 00:08:17.520 || Mint why I couldn't compete with them
00:08:20.210 || 00:08:20.220 || they also offered storage and the young
00:08:22.670 || 00:08:22.680 || man who owned the company is in prison
00:08:24.710 || 00:08:24.720 || with 35 million dollars worth of
00:08:27.230 || 00:08:27.240 || people's metal gone so if you are going
00:08:28.850 || 00:08:28.860 || to choose a storage facility it should
00:08:30.710 || 00:08:30.720 || be third party one with a good balance
00:08:32.029 || 00:08:32.039 || sheet you should be able to know where
00:08:33.949 || 00:08:33.959 || it is at all times and go and retrieve
00:08:35.510 || 00:08:35.520 || it if you have to
00:08:38.389 || 00:08:38.399 || uh and it should be segregated
00:08:40.430 || 00:08:40.440 || um and if you do that you've dotted your
00:08:42.290 || 00:08:42.300 || eyes and crossed your teeth best you
00:08:44.870 || 00:08:44.880 || could and and chosen best you could in
00:08:45.889 || 00:08:45.899 || the world
00:08:48.470 || 00:08:48.480 || where choices aren't always perfect it's
00:08:50.329 || 00:08:50.339 || as good as it's going to get if you have
00:08:53.090 || 00:08:53.100 || to relinquish control to a third party
00:08:56.090 || 00:08:56.100 || so hold it yourself if you can become a
00:08:57.710 || 00:08:57.720 || midnight Gardener and bury it in the
00:08:59.449 || 00:08:59.459 || ground it's better than the safe deposit
00:09:01.970 || 00:09:01.980 || box but if you run out of options or
00:09:04.990 || 00:09:05.000 || peace of mind then a segregated
00:09:08.090 || 00:09:08.100 || strong balance sheet
00:09:10.730 || 00:09:10.740 || um depository where you know where it's
00:09:12.530 || 00:09:12.540 || at at all times and can retrieve it if
00:09:14.269 || 00:09:14.279 || you have to would be the only way that I
00:09:16.610 || 00:09:16.620 || would ever store or relinquish my
00:09:19.370 || 00:09:19.380 || precious metals to a depository and it
00:09:20.570 || 00:09:20.580 || doesn't have to be all or nothing either
00:09:23.389 || 00:09:23.399 || you can use a both and strategy so you
00:09:24.949 || 00:09:24.959 || have some close at hand as much as you
00:09:27.530 || 00:09:27.540 || feel comfortable guarding yourself and
00:09:29.389 || 00:09:29.399 || knowing that sometimes you you're gone
00:09:31.430 || 00:09:31.440 || from your home or whatever people like
00:09:33.470 || 00:09:33.480 || to travel sometimes Etc
00:09:35.750 || 00:09:35.760 || um but then having uh stored elsewhere
00:09:37.790 || 00:09:37.800 || what you're not comfortable uh having
00:09:40.370 || 00:09:40.380 || all in one place perhaps one of the
00:09:42.769 || 00:09:42.779 || things that we heard from multiple
00:09:46.070 || 00:09:46.080 || clients is their distress and these both
00:09:48.410 || 00:09:48.420 || happen to be Ira accounts I believe they
00:09:50.930 || 00:09:50.940 || were where the custodian didn't even
00:09:53.150 || 00:09:53.160 || give them a choice for their silver
00:09:55.670 || 00:09:55.680 || storage in particular of some pretty big
00:09:58.850 || 00:09:58.860 || name uh vaults out east in the eastern
00:10:01.070 || 00:10:01.080 || U.S Seaboard States
00:10:04.370 || 00:10:04.380 || um where it had to be commingled or
00:10:06.410 || 00:10:06.420 || pooled storage and they couldn't get
00:10:08.509 || 00:10:08.519 || segregated and one was particularly just
00:10:10.970 || 00:10:10.980 || stress because she paid a lot of money
00:10:14.449 || 00:10:14.459 || for the very particular coins she put in
00:10:16.850 || 00:10:16.860 || there and when she got back after taking
00:10:19.490 || 00:10:19.500 || a distribution it was this ugly
00:10:21.769 || 00:10:21.779 || dog stuff that she got back and it's
00:10:23.870 || 00:10:23.880 || really important that your stuff be
00:10:26.570 || 00:10:26.580 || yours and stored under your you know
00:10:28.970 || 00:10:28.980 || your separate uh segregated storage
00:10:30.230 || 00:10:30.240 || location
00:10:33.350 || 00:10:33.360 || 100 and I've experienced episodes like
00:10:35.570 || 00:10:35.580 || that that I've probably talked with you
00:10:38.630 || 00:10:38.640 || about to maybe even publicly before
00:10:41.870 || 00:10:41.880 || um and it's a big deal one in particular
00:10:43.930 || 00:10:43.940 || and you know
00:10:51.710 || 00:10:51.720 || um the owner I like a lot I like him
00:10:54.290 || 00:10:54.300 || um his brother-in-law is a good friend
00:10:57.350 || 00:10:57.360 || of mine here in Florida I play golf with
00:10:59.810 || 00:10:59.820 || him twice a week his brother-in-law I
00:11:01.730 || 00:11:01.740 || had lunch with the owner of that
00:11:03.350 || 00:11:03.360 || depository which I'm not going to name
00:11:05.810 || 00:11:05.820 || out of respect and he's a really good
00:11:07.970 || 00:11:07.980 || dude comes from a great family he's an
00:11:10.970 || 00:11:10.980 || honorable upstanding guy and I just went
00:11:12.470 || 00:11:12.480 || back and forth with him I said listen
00:11:15.290 || 00:11:15.300 || until you are able to segregate Ira
00:11:18.350 || 00:11:18.360 || silver I can't in good conscience send
00:11:20.210 || 00:11:20.220 || business there and he said you know well
00:11:22.610 || 00:11:22.620 || the way that we do it it's Eagle for
00:11:25.730 || 00:11:25.740 || eagle or or 100 ounce bar for 100 ounce
00:11:28.970 || 00:11:28.980 || bar I said yeah that's fine but if you
00:11:31.550 || 00:11:31.560 || get back Eagles that are you know I said
00:11:34.069 || 00:11:34.079 || you know let's say you bought 2021 type
00:11:37.069 || 00:11:37.079 || 1 silver eagles those are are very
00:11:38.449 || 00:11:38.459 || expensive what if you bought San
00:11:41.030 || 00:11:41.040 || Francisco men Silver Eagles or you know
00:11:43.730 || 00:11:43.740 || what if you bought uh a Royal Canadian
00:11:46.430 || 00:11:46.440 || mid 100 ounce bars you need to get those
00:11:49.370 || 00:11:49.380 || same things back yes but if you don't
00:11:52.250 || 00:11:52.260 || get even if you do get them back and
00:11:54.710 || 00:11:54.720 || they're in substandard condition that's
00:11:57.650 || 00:11:57.660 || a problem and I've had that happen uh
00:11:59.870 || 00:11:59.880 || and it was a really big deal the biggest
00:12:01.970 || 00:12:01.980 || deal I ever had where this really became
00:12:04.370 || 00:12:04.380 || a problem we're two lovely clients of
00:12:06.949 || 00:12:06.959 || mine from Minnesota you know I uh you
00:12:10.550 || 00:12:10.560 || and I both hail from Minnesota and uh I
00:12:13.970 || 00:12:13.980 || spent a long time there 50 years I moved
00:12:15.470 || 00:12:15.480 || to Florida a year and a half ago but I
00:12:18.350 || 00:12:18.360 || developed a local client uh two clients
00:12:19.910 || 00:12:19.920 || a husband and a wife who were just
00:12:23.090 || 00:12:23.100 || lovely people uh and they sold a big
00:12:25.430 || 00:12:25.440 || candy company
00:12:28.190 || 00:12:28.200 || um they had bought at the time through
00:12:31.730 || 00:12:31.740 || their business close to uh almost seven
00:12:34.250 || 00:12:34.260 || figures worth of 100 ounce Johnson
00:12:36.530 || 00:12:36.540 || Matthew silver bars and silver was six
00:12:38.930 || 00:12:38.940 || dollars or so per ounce when they bought
00:12:40.790 || 00:12:40.800 || it so you can do the math it's a lot of
00:12:43.790 || 00:12:43.800 || ours at 600 plus maybe seven hundred
00:12:46.310 || 00:12:46.320 || dollars a bar you know you're talking
00:12:49.910 || 00:12:49.920 || somewhere in the neighborhood of 1500
00:12:52.490 || 00:12:52.500 || Johnson Matthey 100 ounce bars that were
00:12:54.350 || 00:12:54.360 || in their Ira for a long time and they
00:12:56.050 || 00:12:56.060 || owned a big candy company in Minnesota
00:12:59.569 || 00:12:59.579 || and they sold it the candy company and
00:13:00.410 || 00:13:00.420 || uh
00:13:02.210 || 00:13:02.220 || you know Minnesota and North Dakota
00:13:04.370 || 00:13:04.380 || where our vault is our neighboring
00:13:07.190 || 00:13:07.200 || states from my home in Minneapolis I was
00:13:08.930 || 00:13:08.940 || able to drive to North Dakota in about
00:13:10.850 || 00:13:10.860 || three and a half hours to Fargo
00:13:13.269 || 00:13:13.279 || and they said listen we're gonna go
00:13:17.389 || 00:13:17.399 || we've asked the depository to send the
00:13:20.690 || 00:13:20.700 || bars to your depository in North Dakota
00:13:23.030 || 00:13:23.040 || rather than to our home we want to take
00:13:24.889 || 00:13:24.899 || possession of all of our Silvers since
00:13:27.350 || 00:13:27.360 || we're retiring and we're cashing out our
00:13:30.769 || 00:13:30.779 || 401K our business sponsor 401k and I
00:13:32.389 || 00:13:32.399 || want to take possession of we want to
00:13:34.790 || 00:13:34.800 || take possession of our 100 ounce cars we
00:13:36.290 || 00:13:36.300 || were wondering if you'd come meet us in
00:13:38.870 || 00:13:38.880 || Fargo and we can shape your hand and
00:13:41.210 || 00:13:41.220 || have lunch and I said great that's
00:13:43.910 || 00:13:43.920 || fantastic I'd be happy to so get in the
00:13:46.190 || 00:13:46.200 || car Buzz up to Fargo where you and I
00:13:50.150 || 00:13:50.160 || have filmed once before in the vault and
00:13:52.970 || 00:13:52.980 || um to my when we opened up the
00:13:57.170 || 00:13:57.180 || boxes after lunch uh 95 of them were
00:13:59.750 || 00:13:59.760 || generic bars silver at this point was
00:14:02.329 || 00:14:02.339 || near forty dollars an ounce
00:14:06.470 || 00:14:06.480 || um so they paid under 700 the melt value
00:14:09.530 || 00:14:09.540 || on these bars was four thousand the
00:14:11.210 || 00:14:11.220 || Johnson Matthey bars whether have
00:14:13.610 || 00:14:13.620 || carried a substantial premium the bars
00:14:17.210 || 00:14:17.220 || that they received back were stackable
00:14:19.430 || 00:14:19.440 || bars I forgot the name of the company
00:14:21.050 || 00:14:21.060 || that used to make them they're no longer
00:14:22.970 || 00:14:22.980 || they're kind of like Legos they're neat
00:14:24.949 || 00:14:24.959 || bars but they're generic and they were
00:14:27.470 || 00:14:27.480 || scratched up and they were bid at spot
00:14:29.509 || 00:14:29.519 || where the others would have been bid at
00:14:31.790 || 00:14:31.800 || a buck and a half or two dollars an
00:14:33.650 || 00:14:33.660 || ounce over somewhere in that neighbor
00:14:35.629 || 00:14:35.639 || let's call it even a buck over whatever
00:14:39.889 || 00:14:39.899 || the number is on 1500 bars uh a buck an
00:14:42.050 || 00:14:42.060 || ounce we're talking a lot of money and
00:14:44.629 || 00:14:44.639 || we called the depository and they said
00:14:47.509 || 00:14:47.519 || we're sorry we don't we don't segregate
00:14:50.090 || 00:14:50.100 || Ira silver we just allocate you received
00:14:52.790 || 00:14:52.800 || back 100 ounce bars yes we did
00:14:55.910 || 00:14:55.920 || but they were 95 of them were generic
00:14:57.769 || 00:14:57.779 || you're talking thousands and thousands
00:14:59.810 || 00:14:59.820 || of dollars that these people lost and
00:15:01.009 || 00:15:01.019 || there was nothing that could be done
00:15:02.810 || 00:15:02.820 || about it so
00:15:05.150 || 00:15:05.160 || that's when I first learned about really
00:15:07.730 || 00:15:07.740 || the importance of segregation versus
00:15:09.769 || 00:15:09.779 || allocation yeah they got back 100 ounce
00:15:12.710 || 00:15:12.720 || bars but not the premium bars that they
00:15:14.569 || 00:15:14.579 || bought and I could tell you other
00:15:16.610 || 00:15:16.620 || stories but it's just very very
00:15:19.970 || 00:15:19.980 || important when you are looking for an
00:15:22.790 || 00:15:22.800 || IRA custodian deposit or depository
00:15:25.750 || 00:15:25.760 || through your custodians there are a few
00:15:29.629 || 00:15:29.639 || that segregate Ira silver IDs of Dallas
00:15:32.810 || 00:15:32.820 || and Delaware does the Dakota depository
00:15:36.050 || 00:15:36.060 || in North Dakota does I believe
00:15:38.449 || 00:15:38.459 || the Texas bullion depository does but
00:15:40.550 || 00:15:40.560 || I'm not positive
00:15:43.009 || 00:15:43.019 || quite frankly I send the majority of our
00:15:45.530 || 00:15:45.540 || Ira clients to the Dakota depository and
00:15:48.769 || 00:15:48.779 || to IDs because I know for a fact that
00:15:51.769 || 00:15:51.779 || they segregate metal uh our Brink
00:15:53.870 || 00:15:53.880 || storage program that we're so proud of
00:15:57.110 || 00:15:57.120 || that is fully segregated that's only for
00:15:59.290 || 00:15:59.300 || money outside of an IRA it's called
00:16:01.970 || 00:16:01.980 || non-qualified money but for qualified
00:16:06.470 || 00:16:06.480 || funds Ira type of money we
00:16:09.170 || 00:16:09.180 || um or those those programs are not
00:16:11.990 || 00:16:12.000 || eligible for uh our storage program so
00:16:13.850 || 00:16:13.860 || anyways IDs of Dallas and the Dakota
00:16:16.150 || 00:16:16.160 || depository I do know
00:16:18.769 || 00:16:18.779 || segregate the metal in the name of
00:16:21.350 || 00:16:21.360 || Dunagan so that if you decide that again
00:16:23.150 || 00:16:23.160 || that you want to take possession of your
00:16:25.430 || 00:16:25.440 || IRA medal at any point
00:16:27.290 || 00:16:27.300 || through what's called an in-kind
00:16:28.970 || 00:16:28.980 || distribution see this is the key to the
00:16:31.310 || 00:16:31.320 || whole thing is that to me if you own a
00:16:33.949 || 00:16:33.959 || precious metals Ira that coolest feature
00:16:36.530 || 00:16:36.540 || the best part about it is the ability to
00:16:39.769 || 00:16:39.779 || take possession through an in-kind
00:16:42.769 || 00:16:42.779 || distribution or liquidation uh where
00:16:44.509 || 00:16:44.519 || you're going to be taxed as if you sold
00:16:47.269 || 00:16:47.279 || it but and took a check but here you get
00:16:50.090 || 00:16:50.100 || the metal sent to you in lieu of or in
00:16:52.189 || 00:16:52.199 || addition to a cash distribution so if
00:16:54.769 || 00:16:54.779 || you're going to potentially get back and
00:16:56.629 || 00:16:56.639 || take possession of what is within your
00:16:59.030 || 00:16:59.040 || IRA you're pretty well want it to be
00:17:00.230 || 00:17:00.240 || what
00:17:02.509 || 00:17:02.519 || she paid for what you bought and in the
00:17:04.250 || 00:17:04.260 || condition that it was when it was
00:17:06.530 || 00:17:06.540 || deposited into your IRA presumably Mint
00:17:08.150 || 00:17:08.160 || Condition brand new
00:17:10.610 || 00:17:10.620 || you remember I mean you're reminding me
00:17:14.049 || 00:17:14.059 || of when I bought two brand spanking new
00:17:17.270 || 00:17:17.280 || propane cylinders when we got a new gas
00:17:20.030 || 00:17:20.040 || grill and then I went in once those were
00:17:22.909 || 00:17:22.919 || exhausted and I was gonna swap them out
00:17:25.250 || 00:17:25.260 || at one of these local gas stations that
00:17:27.949 || 00:17:27.959 || has the Blue Rhino cage out out front
00:17:30.169 || 00:17:30.179 || and and and the guy at the store said no
00:17:32.090 || 00:17:32.100 || he says you are not going to want to
00:17:34.610 || 00:17:34.620 || swap these in these are two beautiful he
00:17:35.930 || 00:17:35.940 || said go to this other place down the
00:17:37.490 || 00:17:37.500 || block they'll refill them for you so
00:17:38.690 || 00:17:38.700 || that's what I did and I did that over
00:17:40.310 || 00:17:40.320 || and over again and never swapped them
00:17:43.789 || 00:17:43.799 || out so anyway it's well yeah what you
00:17:45.289 || 00:17:45.299 || pay for you don't want to get something
00:17:48.590 || 00:17:48.600 || back that's ugly and dinged up and or
00:17:51.830 || 00:17:51.840 || can compromise your liquidity and
00:17:54.590 || 00:17:54.600 || um it's it's not a good deal it's just
00:17:56.990 || 00:17:57.000 || not I think here again the theme of
00:17:58.549 || 00:17:58.559 || everything we've talked about since the
00:18:01.310 || 00:18:01.320 || onset of this call has been
00:18:04.250 || 00:18:04.260 || um you know removal of counterparty risk
00:18:08.090 || 00:18:08.100 || uh uh keeping keeping a chain of custody
00:18:13.130 || 00:18:13.140 || in keeping a a you know a pattern of of
00:18:14.990 || 00:18:15.000 || custody from the time you buy it till
00:18:17.450 || 00:18:17.460 || the time you receive it and I just think
00:18:20.510 || 00:18:20.520 || the phrase Pennywise Palm foolish comes
00:18:24.169 || 00:18:24.179 || to mind and you know you can do things
00:18:27.529 || 00:18:27.539 || on the cheap but if you do that it's a
00:18:28.789 || 00:18:28.799 || you know it's going to be to your
00:18:31.250 || 00:18:31.260 || detriment more often than not and just
00:18:34.850 || 00:18:34.860 || as as a footnote the reason that the
00:18:39.049 || 00:18:39.059 || majority of these depositories will not
00:18:41.510 || 00:18:41.520 || segregate Ira silver they'll only
00:18:45.830 || 00:18:45.840 || allocate it is because they know that so
00:18:49.070 || 00:18:49.080 || if you were to open up an account at any
00:18:51.610 || 00:18:51.620 || of the depositories within the IRA
00:18:55.370 || 00:18:55.380 || depository election form outside of an
00:18:57.350 || 00:18:57.360 || IRA you would pay as much as two or
00:18:59.330 || 00:18:59.340 || three times what you pay within the IRA
00:19:02.270 || 00:19:02.280 || so they give the custodians a super
00:19:04.789 || 00:19:04.799 || sweetheart deal because they know that
00:19:06.830 || 00:19:06.840 || the custodian is a constant funnel of
00:19:09.590 || 00:19:09.600 || new business new clients and so they
00:19:12.169 || 00:19:12.179 || lowball their storage rate to a
00:19:14.810 || 00:19:14.820 || custodian who sends them a thousand
00:19:17.930 || 00:19:17.940 || clients in a year uh even though they're
00:19:19.549 || 00:19:19.559 || not making anywhere near the amount of
00:19:21.529 || 00:19:21.539 || money they would if an individual opened
00:19:23.270 || 00:19:23.280 || up the account maybe two to three times
00:19:26.090 || 00:19:26.100 || less than if an individual opened up the
00:19:29.390 || 00:19:29.400 || account so as a result they're paying or
00:19:31.789 || 00:19:31.799 || charging less so they're going to just
00:19:34.310 || 00:19:34.320 || allocate it to the IRA program a big box
00:19:36.890 || 00:19:36.900 || of Silver Eagles anything that's in this
00:19:40.310 || 00:19:40.320 || crate belongs to the Equity Trust Ira
00:19:42.650 || 00:19:42.660 || program doesn't matter that done again
00:19:44.510 || 00:19:44.520 || is one of the people in the Box you're
00:19:46.789 || 00:19:46.799 || not unless you're really lucky you're
00:19:48.289 || 00:19:48.299 || probably not going to get the same coins
00:19:51.049 || 00:19:51.059 || that were put in there in your name but
00:19:54.710 || 00:19:54.720 || it will be the IRA box for equity and I
00:19:56.690 || 00:19:56.700 || apologize for using your name just
00:19:59.090 || 00:19:59.100 || trying to make a point here anyways so
00:20:01.490 || 00:20:01.500 || that's why you find that very often so
00:20:03.650 || 00:20:03.660 || wherever you're storing stay away from
00:20:07.430 || 00:20:07.440 || pooled accounts 100 always and if you're
00:20:09.470 || 00:20:09.480 || gonna store it somewhere it must be
00:20:13.430 || 00:20:13.440 || allocated and segregated and you'll be
00:20:16.250 || 00:20:16.260 || okay if it's a good company the other
00:20:18.710 || 00:20:18.720 || thing that you talked about there was
00:20:21.169 || 00:20:21.179 || the importance of making sure that
00:20:23.270 || 00:20:23.280 || you're dealing with a company that has a
00:20:26.470 || 00:20:26.480 || reputation that they've got you know
00:20:29.450 || 00:20:29.460 || backing or bonding or that sort of thing
00:20:31.310 || 00:20:31.320 || behind it so you know who you're dealing
00:20:32.870 || 00:20:32.880 || with and that's what a lot of the people
00:20:34.909 || 00:20:34.919 || some of the reasons that people also
00:20:36.890 || 00:20:36.900 || even though most people would prefer to
00:20:38.990 || 00:20:39.000 || hold on to their medals have them close
00:20:40.669 || 00:20:40.679 || at hand and you've suggested a bunch of
00:20:42.169 || 00:20:42.179 || strategies for having them at close at
00:20:43.970 || 00:20:43.980 || hand is if you're going to be moving
00:20:45.409 || 00:20:45.419 || like a lot of people have been the last
00:20:46.970 || 00:20:46.980 || couple of years like we've been trying
00:20:51.230 || 00:20:51.240 || to or if you um are uh just reaching the
00:20:53.150 || 00:20:53.160 || point where the physical the amount of
00:20:54.470 || 00:20:54.480 || stacking that you've been doing is just
00:20:55.850 || 00:20:55.860 || getting to be problematic I mean I've
00:20:57.110 || 00:20:57.120 || had people actually call and say look
00:20:58.789 || 00:20:58.799 || you've been sending me
00:21:00.710 || 00:21:00.720 || boxes and boxes and boxes and boxes I'm
00:21:02.450 || 00:21:02.460 || running out of places to put them what
00:21:03.830 || 00:21:03.840 || am I going to do because I still want
00:21:07.610 || 00:21:07.620 || more of my uh investable net worth in
00:21:10.789 || 00:21:10.799 || metals but I just can't fit any more in
00:21:12.890 || 00:21:12.900 || my my living space so that there is
00:21:13.909 || 00:21:13.919 || other reasons people have different
00:21:16.070 || 00:21:16.080 || scenarios but early on you said
00:21:17.690 || 00:21:17.700 || something that was stuck in my ear and
00:21:19.669 || 00:21:19.679 || it is echoed by a viewer's question here
00:21:21.650 || 00:21:21.660 || so let's get to that you said you're
00:21:24.289 || 00:21:24.299 || more likely to be to be taken advantage
00:21:26.150 || 00:21:26.160 || of by the system or by the government
00:21:27.950 || 00:21:27.960 || than you are by somebody burgling your
00:21:30.470 || 00:21:30.480 || house q69 says Andy will the
00:21:32.990 || 00:21:33.000 || government's implementing cbdc's Central
00:21:35.930 || 00:21:35.940 || Bank digital currencies Force stackers
00:21:38.090 || 00:21:38.100 || to convert precious metals to cbdc's
00:21:40.789 || 00:21:40.799 || through the threat of uh by this time
00:21:42.950 || 00:21:42.960 || frame or else so that's been a big
00:21:45.110 || 00:21:45.120 || question uh that's been circulating
00:21:47.330 || 00:21:47.340 || we've been asked pointedly by several
00:21:50.870 || 00:21:50.880 || clients and that is when the next regime
00:21:54.770 || 00:21:54.780 || change comes in uh currency and if
00:21:56.149 || 00:21:56.159 || there's no exit in other words you can't
00:21:57.590 || 00:21:57.600 || withdraw cash and we've gone to this
00:22:00.649 || 00:22:00.659 || cash flow system is it likely that we'll
00:22:02.990 || 00:22:03.000 || be forced a
00:22:05.390 || 00:22:05.400 || told officially that it you know we
00:22:07.789 || 00:22:07.799 || can't transact in uh precious metals
00:22:09.950 || 00:22:09.960 || anymore we've got to turn them in have
00:22:12.110 || 00:22:12.120 || such things happen in the past uh if
00:22:14.630 || 00:22:14.640 || that happens are there alternative
00:22:16.250 || 00:22:16.260 || workarounds for people your thoughts on
00:22:18.409 || 00:22:18.419 || that I don't think it'll happen first of
00:22:20.270 || 00:22:20.280 || all I've said for a long time I don't
00:22:22.549 || 00:22:22.559 || think you'll see confiscation I think
00:22:26.029 || 00:22:26.039 || you have HSBC Bank as the administrator
00:22:28.010 || 00:22:28.020 || of GLD the third or fourth largest
00:22:29.810 || 00:22:29.820 || stockpile of gold in the world and JP
00:22:32.990 || 00:22:33.000 || Morgan of the administrator of SLV the
00:22:34.789 || 00:22:34.799 || second largest stockpile silver in the
00:22:36.890 || 00:22:36.900 || world you have this massive stockpile of
00:22:39.470 || 00:22:39.480 || metal held by the the two crooked cartel
00:22:41.870 || 00:22:41.880 || Banks JP Morgan is is the administrator
00:22:44.390 || 00:22:44.400 || of several ETFs and just signed on to be
00:22:47.630 || 00:22:47.640 || the the to help store the gold for the
00:22:49.669 || 00:22:49.679 || largest gold ETF in the world you have
00:22:52.010 || 00:22:52.020 || these crooked cartel manipulative Banks
00:22:53.630 || 00:22:53.640 || holding the Lion's Share of the gold and
00:22:56.149 || 00:22:56.159 || silver that is being attracted by the
00:22:57.830 || 00:22:57.840 || big fund managers and the financial
00:23:00.649 || 00:23:00.659 || advisors who don't want to relinquish
00:23:02.450 || 00:23:02.460 || money under management and tell someone
00:23:04.490 || 00:23:04.500 || to go buy physical goal because they
00:23:06.289 || 00:23:06.299 || can't manage it but they'll come to buy
00:23:09.110 || 00:23:09.120 || an ETF which continues to stockpile gold
00:23:11.570 || 00:23:11.580 || and silver all of these ETFs and they're
00:23:14.450 || 00:23:14.460 || all managed by and held by the Crooked
00:23:16.970 || 00:23:16.980 || Banks and these Banks very easily if
00:23:18.830 || 00:23:18.840 || there were confiscation could take the
00:23:20.990 || 00:23:21.000 || ETFs they would allow people the ability
00:23:23.029 || 00:23:23.039 || to own physical Metals when you look at
00:23:25.490 || 00:23:25.500 || a country like Russia who has stripped
00:23:28.130 || 00:23:28.140 || the vat tax and telling their people to
00:23:30.710 || 00:23:30.720 || own gold and the same with China it is a
00:23:33.289 || 00:23:33.299 || foundation of wealth Aleister McLeod
00:23:35.810 || 00:23:35.820 || talks about China owning 38 000 tons of
00:23:37.430 || 00:23:37.440 || gold which would be almost five times
00:23:40.610 || 00:23:40.620 || that we own of which 18 000 tons he
00:23:43.250 || 00:23:43.260 || surmises are owned by the people when
00:23:45.950 || 00:23:45.960 || the world is allowing and telling their
00:23:49.130 || 00:23:49.140 || people to own gold and the US is
00:23:51.529 || 00:23:51.539 || clinging to the last messages of the
00:23:53.390 || 00:23:53.400 || world Reserve status in the center of
00:23:55.730 || 00:23:55.740 || free trade acting activating eminent
00:23:57.289 || 00:23:57.299 || domain would be the dumbest thing they
00:23:59.630 || 00:23:59.640 || could do we are the pimple on the
00:24:01.669 || 00:24:01.679 || elephant's rear end the people who own
00:24:03.830 || 00:24:03.840 || physical metal but look at it from from
00:24:07.190 || 00:24:07.200 || a more unemotional standpoint
00:24:08.450 || 00:24:08.460 || um
00:24:11.270 || 00:24:11.280 || we're all going to be in the cvdc right
00:24:12.770 || 00:24:12.780 || the the bank of international
00:24:15.710 || 00:24:15.720 || settlements said that every country
00:24:19.730 || 00:24:19.740 || whose bis member has to have a central
00:24:23.330 || 00:24:23.340 || bank digital currency by 2025. we saw
00:24:26.149 || 00:24:26.159 || the mbridge we've talked about where you
00:24:29.570 || 00:24:29.580 || know a deal between I think it was uh uh
00:24:33.049 || 00:24:33.059 || Hong Kong uh China and United Arab
00:24:35.810 || 00:24:35.820 || Emirates and I want to say Singapore not
00:24:37.549 || 00:24:37.559 || positive on that third country but
00:24:41.409 || 00:24:41.419 || anyways it it's a a vehicle that allows
00:24:43.909 || 00:24:43.919 || cross-interbank trading of Central Bank
00:24:46.010 || 00:24:46.020 || digital currencies this is happening and
00:24:48.830 || 00:24:48.840 || it's going to happen here too uh you
00:24:52.130 || 00:24:52.140 || know there's all this talk of uh 85 000
00:24:54.890 || 00:24:54.900 || new IRS agencies all this new talk of a
00:24:59.149 || 00:24:59.159 || 600 deal if you use venmo I bought some

00:25:24.289 || 00:25:24.299 || tightening the Noose around us in terms
00:25:28.090 || 00:25:28.100 || of taxations for for a

00:25:36.470 || 00:25:36.480 || so heavily indebted at some point we'll
00:25:38.570 || 00:25:38.580 || all have to come back into a central
00:25:40.669 || 00:25:40.679 || bank digital currency come back onto the

00:25:55.130 || 00:25:55.140 || in the Central Bank digital currency
00:25:57.649 || 00:25:57.659 || well tell me about that you know done
00:25:59.450 || 00:25:59.460 || again uh where what'd you pay for it
00:26:00.710 || 00:26:00.720 || when did you get it where are your
00:26:02.810 || 00:26:02.820 || records I see right here that you get
00:26:05.149 || 00:26:05.159 || you know so the point of it is they
00:26:08.149 || 00:26:08.159 || don't need to do that it we represent
00:26:11.269 || 00:26:11.279 || but a stack of dust in the overall
00:26:13.370 || 00:26:13.380 || scheme of things the people who own
00:26:16.130 || 00:26:16.140 || physical metal in this country are um
00:26:17.630 || 00:26:17.640 || are not
00:26:20.570 || 00:26:20.580 || we don't own enough to make a dent but
00:26:22.669 || 00:26:22.679 || and and I think the backlash the
00:26:24.590 || 00:26:24.600 || unintended consequences of activating
00:26:26.690 || 00:26:26.700 || eminent domain we would lose all trust
00:26:29.029 || 00:26:29.039 || immediately more so than we already have
00:26:31.450 || 00:26:31.460 || from all of our creditors if they feared
00:26:34.610 || 00:26:34.620 || nationalization of assets like that so I
00:26:38.029 || 00:26:38.039 || think that no we won't be forced to
00:26:41.269 || 00:26:41.279 || liquidate I think that this is kind of
00:26:43.490 || 00:26:43.500 || like a bear trap in the respect that
00:26:46.010 || 00:26:46.020 || when it comes time to liquidate
00:26:49.130 || 00:26:49.140 || you're going into the cvdc and from that
00:26:52.610 || 00:26:52.620 || point forward you have zero anonymity
00:26:54.710 || 00:26:54.720 || now you know
00:26:56.690 || 00:26:56.700 || um what does that mean don't know I
00:26:58.430 || 00:26:58.440 || guess we have to roll with it and see
00:27:00.409 || 00:27:00.419 || how it all plays out but I don't think
00:27:02.029 || 00:27:02.039 || they're going to force us to liquidate
00:27:03.950 || 00:27:03.960 || but I think when we do liquidate we
00:27:07.130 || 00:27:07.140 || better have our ducks in a row and our
00:27:09.830 || 00:27:09.840 || eyes Dot and our T's crossed and um
00:27:13.789 || 00:27:13.799 || because if not I think you know these 85
00:27:16.250 || 00:27:16.260 || 000 IRS agents well they're not there
00:27:19.190 || 00:27:19.200 || just to uh to answer phone calls they're
00:27:20.390 || 00:27:20.400 || they're they're they're going to be
00:27:22.370 || 00:27:22.380 || looking for people who are not paying
00:27:25.669 || 00:27:25.679 || their taxes the right way and
00:27:28.430 || 00:27:28.440 || um you know I think that the cbdc will
00:27:30.830 || 00:27:30.840 || just be a way for them to much more
00:27:32.690 || 00:27:32.700 || easily do their job because there'll be
00:27:34.789 || 00:27:34.799 || records of everything from that point
00:27:35.930 || 00:27:35.940 || forward
00:27:37.789 || 00:27:37.799 || got a question here that comes up
00:27:40.250 || 00:27:40.260 || probably every week if not every day
00:27:42.529 || 00:27:42.539 || when uh getting called by clients about
00:27:44.810 || 00:27:44.820 || bullion Kate B says what's the
00:27:46.970 || 00:27:46.980 || difference between a silver buffalo coin
00:27:49.549 || 00:27:49.559 || and a silver eagle coin a lot of people
00:27:51.289 || 00:27:51.299 || think that the silver Buffalo was made
00:27:53.630 || 00:27:53.640 || by the U.S mint and it's not and it's
00:27:55.549 || 00:27:55.559 || misleading because the U.S mint makes
00:27:58.730 || 00:27:58.740 || the gold buffalo and the Gold Eagle the
00:28:00.649 || 00:28:00.659 || U.S mint does not make a silver Buffalo
00:28:03.230 || 00:28:03.240 || they make a silver eagle they make a
00:28:04.789 || 00:28:04.799 || five ounce silver America they're
00:28:06.230 || 00:28:06.240 || beautiful they make some other silver
00:28:09.350 || 00:28:09.360 || coins odds and ends but their main stay
00:28:11.450 || 00:28:11.460 || is the one ounce American Silver Eagle
00:28:14.149 || 00:28:14.159 || in Gold it's the one ounce gold buffalo
00:28:17.450 || 00:28:17.460 || and the one ounce gold eagle and it's
00:28:18.830 || 00:28:18.840 || interesting they really don't make any
00:28:21.409 || 00:28:21.419 || fractional gold buffaloes one half one
00:28:23.330 || 00:28:23.340 || quarter one-tenth but they do in the
00:28:26.090 || 00:28:26.100 || gold and platinum Eagles so it the whole
00:28:28.070 || 00:28:28.080 || thing is a little confusing the bottom
00:28:30.230 || 00:28:30.240 || line is is that the Buffalo silver round
00:28:33.230 || 00:28:33.240 || for whatever reason is one of the more
00:28:35.870 || 00:28:35.880 || popular designs chosen by the Myriad of
00:28:40.789 || 00:28:40.799 || of refiners out there that make the same
00:28:43.510 || 00:28:43.520 || design or a similar design
00:28:46.789 || 00:28:46.799 || it looks very much like a coin it's very
00:28:49.250 || 00:28:49.260 || popular but it is not made by the US
00:28:52.010 || 00:28:52.020 || government it is not legal tender it is
00:28:54.830 || 00:28:54.840 || a generic round it is a a piece of
00:28:56.810 || 00:28:56.820 || silver with a couple of a stamps on
00:28:58.610 || 00:28:58.620 || either side that make it look like a
00:29:00.950 || 00:29:00.960 || coin but not issued by the US government
00:29:03.470 || 00:29:03.480 || no big difference
00:29:06.049 || 00:29:06.059 || what about wearable uh precious metals
00:29:07.250 || 00:29:07.260 || we've got a number of questions here
00:29:10.010 || 00:29:10.020 || about uh jewelry different types of
00:29:11.750 || 00:29:11.760 || forms of jewelry some of which have
00:29:13.730 || 00:29:13.740 || standardized number you know grams per
00:29:15.470 || 00:29:15.480 || bead in a necklace that sort of thing
00:29:17.090 || 00:29:17.100 || where you can use those any advantages
00:29:19.130 || 00:29:19.140 || from your standpoint of owning a
00:29:20.990 || 00:29:21.000 || wearable medal I guess if you're gonna
00:29:24.590 || 00:29:24.600 || travel you know you could call that an
00:29:27.830 || 00:29:27.840 || advantage I and even if it says how much
00:29:31.730 || 00:29:31.740 || it is I guess I guess that's good uh the
00:29:34.070 || 00:29:34.080 || the you know the standard answer is most
00:29:36.289 || 00:29:36.299 || people don't know how much any of the
00:29:38.510 || 00:29:38.520 || gold they own is worth or what it really
00:29:40.669 || 00:29:40.679 || weighs or how to do the calculation from
00:29:44.870 || 00:29:44.880 || 14 or 21 carat uh to figure out its true
00:29:47.630 || 00:29:47.640 || melt value and so it lacks liquidity I
00:29:49.250 || 00:29:49.260 || think one of the things that's so nice
00:29:52.430 || 00:29:52.440 || about about coins is is the
00:29:55.370 || 00:29:55.380 || non-subjective nature of it where you
00:29:57.529 || 00:29:57.539 || know you know what you have it's clearly
00:30:00.649 || 00:30:00.659 || marked in stamped whereas you have
00:30:02.870 || 00:30:02.880 || um the the jewelry there there are a lot
00:30:05.029 || 00:30:05.039 || of companies out over the years Cash for
00:30:07.610 || 00:30:07.620 || Gold that you know scammed the public to
00:30:11.690 || 00:30:11.700 || the nth degree because no one knows what
00:30:13.789 || 00:30:13.799 || it is that they have and how much it's
00:30:15.409 || 00:30:15.419 || worth and so
00:30:17.870 || 00:30:17.880 || you know you need you can have the
00:30:19.310 || 00:30:19.320 || greatest thing in the world but if it
00:30:23.810 || 00:30:23.820 || lacks liquidity or transparency
00:30:27.289 || 00:30:27.299 || um you're at a compromised position so
00:30:29.029 || 00:30:29.039 || yes if you had something that was
00:30:31.610 || 00:30:31.620 || clearly marked you know the the weight
00:30:34.190 || 00:30:34.200 || and and whatnot I guess it's better than
00:30:37.430 || 00:30:37.440 || just a chain but um really not something
00:30:40.850 || 00:30:40.860 || I've ever entertained I prefer I'm very
00:30:43.130 || 00:30:43.140 || very simple I prefer either one ounce
00:30:45.529 || 00:30:45.539 || gold bars one ounce gold Eagles or one
00:30:48.769 || 00:30:48.779 || ounce well buffalos if I had my brothers
00:30:52.010 || 00:30:52.020 || I would buy the pre-33 U.S gold coins if
00:30:54.409 || 00:30:54.419 || the premiums were were good like the
00:30:56.870 || 00:30:56.880 || special we ran last week
00:30:59.210 || 00:30:59.220 || um I think that
00:31:01.970 || 00:31:01.980 || um when you get cross into the jewelry
00:31:04.789 || 00:31:04.799 || if you're getting a good deal on it or
00:31:06.649 || 00:31:06.659 || again is It Pennywise pump foolish
00:31:09.110 || 00:31:09.120 || thinking the only person that that
00:31:10.909 || 00:31:10.919 || really makes sense to me would be
00:31:12.950 || 00:31:12.960 || someone who is doing an awful lot of
00:31:14.870 || 00:31:14.880 || traveling maybe going to and from
00:31:17.269 || 00:31:17.279 || Central or South America
00:31:19.669 || 00:31:19.679 || um where bringing your gold on an
00:31:21.889 || 00:31:21.899 || airplane to you know South America or
00:31:24.590 || 00:31:24.600 || Central America or Mexico
00:31:27.409 || 00:31:27.419 || um is not so easy this would be a way to
00:31:29.570 || 00:31:29.580 || do it with a little bit um with a little
00:31:32.389 || 00:31:32.399 || bit easier of a pathway than declaring
00:31:35.149 || 00:31:35.159 || your gold coins uh that you bring with
00:31:38.029 || 00:31:38.039 || you in your carry-on
00:31:40.190 || 00:31:40.200 || another question that we have in the uh
00:31:44.149 || 00:31:44.159 || in the chat is about uh when people pay
00:31:46.130 || 00:31:46.140 || with cash
00:31:48.289 || 00:31:48.299 || um uh forms of payment or whether that
00:31:50.870 || 00:31:50.880 || causes reporting uh miles Franklin does
00:31:52.789 || 00:31:52.799 || not accept any cash Subs any cash
00:31:54.230 || 00:31:54.240 || equivalents other than money orders and
00:31:56.149 || 00:31:56.159 || those only in less than ten thousand
00:31:57.350 || 00:31:57.360 || dollar amounts
00:31:59.570 || 00:31:59.580 || um any reporting when people purchase
00:32:01.310 || 00:32:01.320 || precious metals or is or is it
00:32:02.750 || 00:32:02.760 || completely private transaction with
00:32:05.029 || 00:32:05.039 || purchasing Metals yeah we used to accept
00:32:07.190 || 00:32:07.200 || cash and then our bank got a little
00:32:09.350 || 00:32:09.360 || freaky about it and so we don't take
00:32:12.889 || 00:32:12.899 || cash any longer in in if you did pay
00:32:15.470 || 00:32:15.480 || with cash or cash cash instruments and
00:32:17.810 || 00:32:17.820 || if it were with another company that
00:32:20.990 || 00:32:21.000 || accepted it if you pay anything over ten
00:32:22.490 || 00:32:22.500 || thousand dollars they are supposed to
00:32:24.769 || 00:32:24.779 || issue a form 8300 and we've talked about
00:32:27.350 || 00:32:27.360 || this before whether you're you're buying
00:32:30.289 || 00:32:30.299 || a new wardrobe at Nordstrom's or four
00:32:32.570 || 00:32:32.580 || sets of golf clubs for your four kids at
00:32:36.590 || 00:32:36.600 || uh at PGA Superstore or or a new F-150
00:32:39.230 || 00:32:39.240 || and if you pay with anything over ten
00:32:41.450 || 00:32:41.460 || thousand legal tender cash even if it's
00:32:43.789 || 00:32:43.799 || only partial payment you need a form
00:32:46.850 || 00:32:46.860 || 8300 which is basically a form that says
00:32:49.310 || 00:32:49.320 || well you know this gentleman or or this
00:32:51.950 || 00:32:51.960 || woman came in and made a purchase for a
00:32:53.870 || 00:32:53.880 || new wardrobe for her whole family at
00:32:56.149 || 00:32:56.159 || Nordstrom's and paid with 12 000 in cash
00:32:57.710 || 00:32:57.720 || they're going to want her social
00:33:00.430 || 00:33:00.440 || security number the the number of bills
00:33:03.169 || 00:33:03.179 || your address all that kind of stuff and
00:33:06.110 || 00:33:06.120 || really it's it's matching up with with
00:33:09.350 || 00:33:09.360 || uh you know W-2s or or what not to make
00:33:10.850 || 00:33:10.860 || sure that that person really has the
00:33:12.350 || 00:33:12.360 || ability to have that kind of cash it's
00:33:13.570 || 00:33:13.580 || just another
00:33:16.909 || 00:33:16.919 || loss of privacy thing but no we don't
00:33:19.210 || 00:33:19.220 || take it if you pay with a check a wire
00:33:23.509 || 00:33:23.519 || uh even if paid with crypto
00:33:27.049 || 00:33:27.059 || um there's no dealer reporting at all
00:33:29.750 || 00:33:29.760 || and there's no personal reporting
00:33:32.269 || 00:33:32.279 || at all the reporting comes
00:33:35.210 || 00:33:35.220 || when you sell and it's only some things
00:33:37.789 || 00:33:37.799 || that we are required to report most of
00:33:39.409 || 00:33:39.419 || it if not all of it
00:33:42.049 || 00:33:42.059 || is the honor System where you are
00:33:43.789 || 00:33:43.799 || supposed to tell your accountant that
00:33:45.649 || 00:33:45.659 || hey I sold x amount of gold and silver
00:33:48.590 || 00:33:48.600 || in the in this reporting year here's
00:33:50.269 || 00:33:50.279 || what I paid here's what I sold it for
00:33:52.430 || 00:33:52.440 || and that's where it ends some things
00:33:54.409 || 00:33:54.419 || that people sell will trigger dealer
00:33:58.009 || 00:33:58.019 || reporting and that is only a 10.99 and
00:34:00.769 || 00:34:00.779 || that 1099 doesn't say what you paid for
00:34:04.430 || 00:34:04.440 || it uh it it just says that you sold some
00:34:06.230 || 00:34:06.240 || metal and this is the proceeds that you
00:34:09.169 || 00:34:09.179 || received back yeah folks uh if you want
00:34:11.629 || 00:34:11.639 || to know what metals are on the 1099 B
00:34:13.669 || 00:34:13.679 || reporting list when you do sell them to

00:34:32.510 || 00:34:32.520 || metals because there's only certain ones
00:34:34.550 || 00:34:34.560 || and only in certain quantities within a
00:34:36.109 || 00:34:36.119 || single transaction that will trigger
00:34:38.030 || 00:34:38.040 || report when you sell but never when you
00:34:40.010 || 00:34:40.020 || buy and you get another question from
00:34:42.530 || 00:34:42.540 || Christopher Bick Andy how would you
00:34:45.109 || 00:34:45.119 || cross borders with wealth in hand
00:34:47.570 || 00:34:47.580 || depends where you're going
00:34:49.430 || 00:34:49.440 || um I I've told the story many times
00:34:53.869 || 00:34:53.879 || going home from Montreal with 240 ounces
00:34:55.970 || 00:34:55.980 || of gold I can try to tell that in a very
00:34:58.609 || 00:34:58.619 || condensed manner here in a second but I
00:35:00.410 || 00:35:00.420 || what I'm about to tell you I would only
00:35:02.570 || 00:35:02.580 || try going in and out of the U.S from
00:35:05.390 || 00:35:05.400 || Canada from Western Europe perhaps
00:35:07.970 || 00:35:07.980 || Australia New Zealand would not try this
00:35:09.829 || 00:35:09.839 || in Asia would not try this in Mexico
00:35:11.810 || 00:35:11.820 || would not try this in Central or South
00:35:12.730 || 00:35:12.740 || America
00:35:15.589 || 00:35:15.599 || I have always told people that with
00:35:17.390 || 00:35:17.400 || legal tender coins like the American
00:35:20.030 || 00:35:20.040 || Eagles 50 Face Value the maple leaf is
00:35:24.230 || 00:35:24.240 || also 50. uh those are legal tender items
00:35:26.630 || 00:35:26.640 || they're not currency but they're legal
00:35:27.890 || 00:35:27.900 || tender
00:35:31.609 || 00:35:31.619 || um and so for the purposes of traveling
00:35:34.790 || 00:35:34.800 || across border if you have 20 Gold Eagles
00:35:37.670 || 00:35:37.680 || on you and you're going into Canada you
00:35:39.530 || 00:35:39.540 || don't have
00:35:42.109 || 00:35:42.119 || um forty thousand dollars thirty nine
00:35:44.329 || 00:35:44.339 || thousand dollars you have a thousand
00:35:47.870 || 00:35:47.880 || dollars face value 20 times 50. and so I
00:35:50.569 || 00:35:50.579 || put this into uh practice a few times
00:35:52.970 || 00:35:52.980 || coming home from Canada the the the the
00:35:56.150 || 00:35:56.160 || the one that has really got the most
00:35:58.490 || 00:35:58.500 || attention was coming uh from Montreal
00:36:01.970 || 00:36:01.980 || with 240 gold Maple Leafs 240 times 50
00:36:05.690 || 00:36:05.700 || is 12 000 and when you come through any
00:36:08.569 || 00:36:08.579 || Port of Entry in Canada through an
00:36:10.250 || 00:36:10.260 || airport you go through Homeland Security
00:36:12.829 || 00:36:12.839 || and immigration customs in that airport
00:36:15.290 || 00:36:15.300 || so that when I land in Florida or
00:36:17.329 || 00:36:17.339 || wherever else I'm landing I don't go
00:36:19.730 || 00:36:19.740 || through customs there so when I got up
00:36:21.710 || 00:36:21.720 || to the window I told the gentleman I had
00:36:24.050 || 00:36:24.060 || 240 gold Maple Leaves worth twelve
00:36:27.829 || 00:36:27.839 || thousand dollars and I and I needed to
00:36:31.010 || 00:36:31.020 || um and I wrote on the Customs form that
00:36:33.470 || 00:36:33.480 || I had over ten thousand dollars with me
00:36:37.550 || 00:36:37.560 || because the the value 50 times 240 was
00:36:39.710 || 00:36:39.720 || 12 000 so he said what do you have and I
00:36:42.530 || 00:36:42.540 || said I have 240 gold maple leaves and he
00:36:43.730 || 00:36:43.740 || said well you need you're gonna need to
00:36:45.950 || 00:36:45.960 || go to further screening and shut off the
00:36:47.450 || 00:36:47.460 || light of his booth and paraded me down
00:36:49.569 || 00:36:49.579 || to the basement of the Montreal Airport
00:36:52.490 || 00:36:52.500 || to a room that was all glass and
00:36:54.109 || 00:36:54.119 || stainless steel where they wouldn't hear
00:36:56.810 || 00:36:56.820 || you scream and he said don't touch your
00:36:58.430 || 00:36:58.440 || bag sit down someone will be with you
00:37:00.710 || 00:37:00.720 || shortly and he was gone I turned around
00:37:02.390 || 00:37:02.400 || and I'm all alone in the mirrored room
00:37:04.790 || 00:37:04.800 || and it was it was a little surreal you
00:37:06.770 || 00:37:06.780 || know they're watching me about 20
00:37:08.210 || 00:37:08.220 || minutes later a Homeland Security
00:37:10.970 || 00:37:10.980 || Supervisor came out and asked me what I
00:37:12.770 || 00:37:12.780 || had and I said like I told your
00:37:15.470 || 00:37:15.480 || associate I have 240 gold Maple Leaves
00:37:17.329 || 00:37:17.339 || they're 50 face value coins I'm
00:37:19.910 || 00:37:19.920 || declaring twelve thousand dollars C and
00:37:21.650 || 00:37:21.660 || I give them a coin he says you know I'm
00:37:24.109 || 00:37:24.119 || inclined to believe you Mr sheckman
00:37:26.089 || 00:37:26.099 || um let me ask you a few questions this
00:37:28.370 || 00:37:28.380 || was a few years ago he says how much is
00:37:31.069 || 00:37:31.079 || gold I said it's 12 uh it's twelve
00:37:32.990 || 00:37:33.000 || hundred dollars it's an ounce
00:37:36.290 || 00:37:36.300 || and uh he says well
00:37:40.130 || 00:37:40.140 || um isn't that uh about three hundred
00:37:41.810 || 00:37:41.820 || thousand dollars that you're bringing
00:37:45.710 || 00:37:45.720 || into the United States and I said it is
00:37:47.990 || 00:37:48.000 || um but as you can see there's a fifty
00:37:51.050 || 00:37:51.060 || dollar face value on that it is legal
00:37:53.569 || 00:37:53.579 || tender and for that reason I'm only
00:37:55.849 || 00:37:55.859 || declaring twelve thousand dollars legal
00:37:58.430 || 00:37:58.440 || tender Canadian League he says you know
00:37:59.750 || 00:37:59.760 || I'm inclined to believe you but I'm
00:38:01.190 || 00:38:01.200 || going to need to do a little research
00:38:02.569 || 00:38:02.579 || I'm going to borrow your coin in the
00:38:04.370 || 00:38:04.380 || meantime you fill out this Finn sin form
00:38:06.710 || 00:38:06.720 || and this is a form no one ever wants to
00:38:08.569 || 00:38:08.579 || see you don't ever want to fill it out
00:38:10.370 || 00:38:10.380 || the acronym is something to the extent
00:38:12.609 || 00:38:12.619 || of financial uh
00:38:15.250 || 00:38:15.260 || investigation or financial enforcement
00:38:18.230 || 00:38:18.240 || uh criminal investigation whatever it is
00:38:20.810 || 00:38:20.820 || it's a form I had no interest in taking
00:38:22.970 || 00:38:22.980 || part of but it was the gold didn't
00:38:24.829 || 00:38:24.839 || belongings from a very large client of
00:38:26.630 || 00:38:26.640 || mine in Montreal asked me to bring it
00:38:28.670 || 00:38:28.680 || back to our vaulting program in the
00:38:31.790 || 00:38:31.800 || United States so I did anyways to make a
00:38:33.530 || 00:38:33.540 || long story short the office officer
00:38:34.630 || 00:38:34.640 || comes back
00:38:37.370 || 00:38:37.380 || uh he gives me my coin he says I'll be
00:38:40.130 || 00:38:40.140 || damned you're right it is legal tender
00:38:42.170 || 00:38:42.180 || um let me see the fencing form I hand it
00:38:45.890 || 00:38:45.900 || to him and he says I almost forgot how
00:38:47.930 || 00:38:47.940 || much money they have on you and I'm
00:38:50.390 || 00:38:50.400 || thinking oh boy here we go so I open up
00:38:53.150 || 00:38:53.160 || my wallet and I have about 37 I tell him
00:38:55.069 || 00:38:55.079 || such he says are you sure
00:38:58.069 || 00:38:58.079 || I said yeah he says are you positive I
00:38:59.569 || 00:38:59.579 || said look I might have some money and
00:39:01.609 || 00:39:01.619 || change in the bottom of my backpack but
00:39:03.890 || 00:39:03.900 || that's all and he says okay and he tears
00:39:05.569 || 00:39:05.579 || up the thin sin for him he says you're
00:39:08.030 || 00:39:08.040 || free to go I said well that's very nice
00:39:10.190 || 00:39:10.200 || of you but could you please elaborate he
00:39:11.810 || 00:39:11.820 || says I figured you'd ask this guy should
00:39:14.630 || 00:39:14.640 || have wore one an Academy Award for the
00:39:17.450 || 00:39:17.460 || way he strung me along he said you are
00:39:18.829 || 00:39:18.839 || entering the United States with some
00:39:21.170 || 00:39:21.180 || with some change in your backpack and 37
00:39:22.730 || 00:39:22.740 || dollars in your wallet to the best of
00:39:24.589 || 00:39:24.599 || your knowledge is that correct yes sir
00:39:26.750 || 00:39:26.760 || that is correct and you are entering the
00:39:29.089 || 00:39:29.099 || United States with 240 gold maple leaves
00:39:31.430 || 00:39:31.440 || with a 50 face value equivalent of
00:39:33.589 || 00:39:33.599 || twelve thousand dollars Canadian is that
00:39:36.710 || 00:39:36.720 || correct yes sir that is correct well the
00:39:38.750 || 00:39:38.760 || exchange rate today puts that at ninety
00:39:40.550 || 00:39:40.560 || seven hundred dollars and with the money
00:39:42.650 || 00:39:42.660 || in your backpack in your wallet you were
00:39:44.329 || 00:39:44.339 || under the ten thousand dollar threshold
00:39:46.970 || 00:39:46.980 || he tore up the fence in for me said have
00:39:49.550 || 00:39:49.560 || a nice day so the moral of the story is
00:39:51.829 || 00:39:51.839 || if you know where you are going and you
00:39:54.589 || 00:39:54.599 || are are familiar with what to say you
00:39:58.130 || 00:39:58.140 || can take or coins across the border I
00:40:00.230 || 00:40:00.240 || wouldn't even declare them I would put
00:40:03.290 || 00:40:03.300 || them in my bag where my carry-on I would
00:40:05.690 || 00:40:05.700 || take them out of my bag and put them in
00:40:08.870 || 00:40:08.880 || the tray where you put your shoes and
00:40:10.790 || 00:40:10.800 || being forthright about it and as it goes
00:40:14.030 || 00:40:14.040 || by the X-ray machine trying to hey hey
00:40:17.690 || 00:40:17.700 || coins coins hey coins in there you can
00:40:19.790 || 00:40:19.800 || mouth it and most of the time I'll be
00:40:22.490 || 00:40:22.500 || like okay okay and if they say hey I
00:40:23.870 || 00:40:23.880 || want to see what's in the box you can
00:40:25.490 || 00:40:25.500 || request further screening they'll bring
00:40:27.589 || 00:40:27.599 || into a back room you could they'll look
00:40:29.390 || 00:40:29.400 || at it and they're always amazed by it
00:40:31.069 || 00:40:31.079 || they're always very cool I've never had
00:40:33.650 || 00:40:33.660 || a problem just be open about it don't
00:40:35.630 || 00:40:35.640 || try and do it and and act as though
00:40:37.849 || 00:40:37.859 || you're hiding anything now that's when
00:40:39.890 || 00:40:39.900 || you leave the airport when you get into
00:40:42.050 || 00:40:42.060 || the other country this is where you have
00:40:44.450 || 00:40:44.460 || to make a decision do I want to declare
00:40:45.650 || 00:40:45.660 || it or not
00:40:49.250 || 00:40:49.260 || because if you don't declare it you know
00:40:52.370 || 00:40:52.380 || you're right but you may get a TSA agent
00:40:54.290 || 00:40:54.300 || who's not quite sure if the world's
00:40:55.490 || 00:40:55.500 || gonna have to go through a whole big
00:40:58.670 || 00:40:58.680 || rigmarole you could always declare it
00:41:01.310 || 00:41:01.320 || and declaration is just saying hey this
00:41:03.670 || 00:41:03.680 || is what I got nothing illegal about it
00:41:06.650 || 00:41:06.660 || that's up to you
00:41:08.990 || 00:41:09.000 || um so moral of the story if you're
00:41:11.569 || 00:41:11.579 || bringing gold bars or gold krugerrands
00:41:13.670 || 00:41:13.680 || which don't have a face value it's an
00:41:16.310 || 00:41:16.320 || ounce of gold you're bringing a a Gold
00:41:18.290 || 00:41:18.300 || Eagle into Canada it's fifty dollars
00:41:20.569 || 00:41:20.579 || United States
00:41:23.630 || 00:41:23.640 || conversion rate applies so that's a
00:41:25.790 || 00:41:25.800 || pretty good analogy of it if you're
00:41:27.650 || 00:41:27.660 || going to a part of the world where
00:41:30.230 || 00:41:30.240 || you're not certain or you're not really
00:41:32.270 || 00:41:32.280 || sure it's going to be very friendly such
00:41:35.450 || 00:41:35.460 || as Asia Central or South America or
00:41:38.390 || 00:41:38.400 || Mexico don't do it it's not worth it if
00:41:39.890 || 00:41:39.900 || you're going to Mexico or Central or
00:41:42.230 || 00:41:42.240 || South America get some little two or two
00:41:44.210 || 00:41:44.220 || and a half peso coins about the size of
00:41:46.490 || 00:41:46.500 || a button on a shirt button on your shirt
00:41:47.930 || 00:41:47.940 || right there they're no bigger than that
00:41:50.569 || 00:41:50.579 || and you can put those in a change purse
00:41:52.190 || 00:41:52.200 || or throw half a dozen inside your
00:41:55.130 || 00:41:55.140 || luggage and slowly build up each time
00:41:58.069 || 00:41:58.079 || you come back and forth uh some gold in
00:42:00.170 || 00:42:00.180 || a form that is very small and people in
00:42:02.510 || 00:42:02.520 || the Latin speaking culture country would
00:42:04.250 || 00:42:04.260 || understand what the two and two and a
00:42:07.790 || 00:42:07.800 || half peso is so there are ways to do it
00:42:10.069 || 00:42:10.079 || you can always call us and ask if you
00:42:13.069 || 00:42:13.079 || have questions but don't try to ever
00:42:15.170 || 00:42:15.180 || bring something in under the radar it's
00:42:16.910 || 00:42:16.920 || not worth it they'll take it you won't
00:42:18.470 || 00:42:18.480 || get it back
00:42:20.569 || 00:42:20.579 || two related questions here following up
00:42:21.890 || 00:42:21.900 || on your statements earlier about the
00:42:23.450 || 00:42:23.460 || difference between uh Buffalo silver
00:42:26.030 || 00:42:26.040 || buffaloes versus uh American Eagles for
00:42:28.430 || 00:42:28.440 || example Thomas toop says important to
00:42:31.609 || 00:42:31.619 || note that rounds are not coins and Kate
00:42:33.770 || 00:42:33.780 || B says and why would anyone purchase
00:42:35.630 || 00:42:35.640 || silver buffaloes or other rounds if
00:42:38.470 || 00:42:38.480 || they're not legal tender
00:42:40.310 || 00:42:40.320 || uh
00:42:43.430 || 00:42:43.440 || why why would people drink generic Soda
00:42:45.650 || 00:42:45.660 || instead of Coca-Cola
00:42:48.829 || 00:42:48.839 || um it's announced it's announced that in
00:42:50.569 || 00:42:50.579 || in the case of the soda at both drinks
00:42:52.430 || 00:42:52.440 || they both drink the same one is more
00:42:56.270 || 00:42:56.280 || recognized uh in the case of the legal
00:42:59.270 || 00:42:59.280 || tender aspect of a silver coin or a gold
00:43:02.270 || 00:43:02.280 || coin you know I often wonder what why is
00:43:04.370 || 00:43:04.380 || there even any legal tender amount on it
00:43:06.710 || 00:43:06.720 || to begin with who in their right mind is
00:43:08.270 || 00:43:08.280 || going to sell the Gold Eagle for fifty
00:43:10.130 || 00:43:10.140 || dollars who in their right mind is going
00:43:12.770 || 00:43:12.780 || to sell a silver eagle for a dollar so
00:43:15.290 || 00:43:15.300 || you know the legal tender aspect of it
00:43:16.450 || 00:43:16.460 || is
00:43:19.910 || 00:43:19.920 || somewhat suspect to begin with
00:43:21.890 || 00:43:21.900 || the reason someone would buy a buffalo
00:43:24.349 || 00:43:24.359 || round over a silver eagle is that you're
00:43:26.089 || 00:43:26.099 || getting an ounce of silver at a much
00:43:29.510 || 00:43:29.520 || more favorable price you don't have the
00:43:31.430 || 00:43:31.440 || premium what is premium it's a function
00:43:33.410 || 00:43:33.420 || of supply and demand therefore there's
00:43:34.790 || 00:43:34.800 || greater demand
00:43:37.550 || 00:43:37.560 || for the legal tender coins then there is
00:43:41.270 || 00:43:41.280 || a generic silver round but in the end if
00:43:43.910 || 00:43:43.920 || if you drop both of them into a blast
00:43:46.010 || 00:43:46.020 || furnace you'll have an ounce of liquid
00:43:47.809 || 00:43:47.819 || silver you won't be able to tell the two
00:43:51.470 || 00:43:51.480 || apart so in the end they both drink the
00:43:54.829 || 00:43:54.839 || same one is a little bit more recognized
00:43:57.470 || 00:43:57.480 || than the other but one is also going to
00:43:59.390 || 00:43:59.400 || give you a much better value for your
00:44:04.130 || 00:44:04.140 || dollar arguably than the other
00:44:06.710 || 00:44:06.720 || we've got a question here about
00:44:08.690 || 00:44:08.700 || um I gotta find it now I had it just a
00:44:10.430 || 00:44:10.440 || minute ago you're doing a great job
00:44:12.020 || 00:44:12.030 || multitasking
00:44:14.390 || 00:44:14.400 || [Laughter]
00:44:16.250 || 00:44:16.260 || um well this is another thing that we
00:44:18.050 || 00:44:18.060 || had interviewed uh constitutional
00:44:20.450 || 00:44:20.460 || attorney Edwin Vera Dr Edwin Vera on
00:44:22.010 || 00:44:22.020 || there he said there are certain States
00:44:24.710 || 00:44:24.720 || in our country which had uh gold
00:44:27.410 || 00:44:27.420 || contract laws on their books within
00:44:29.150 || 00:44:29.160 || their states in the in the constitution
00:44:30.650 || 00:44:30.660 || of their states you could buy and sell
00:44:32.510 || 00:44:32.520 || real estate you know ranches or other
00:44:34.970 || 00:44:34.980 || property and you can make a gold
00:44:37.130 || 00:44:37.140 || contract and he said that there's been a
00:44:38.390 || 00:44:38.400 || kind of an arm wrestling between the
00:44:39.829 || 00:44:39.839 || federal government that wants to
00:44:42.170 || 00:44:42.180 || invalidate gold contracts or has and
00:44:43.730 || 00:44:43.740 || states that are trying to enforce it
00:44:45.530 || 00:44:45.540 || within the within the boundaries of
00:44:48.250 || 00:44:48.260 || their state that they should be uh legal
00:44:51.710 || 00:44:51.720 || and now that's not necessarily an area
00:44:53.510 || 00:44:53.520 || of expertise from you but have you
00:44:55.490 || 00:44:55.500 || talked with others about the what the
00:44:58.190 || 00:44:58.200 || direction that's heading in no I haven't
00:45:00.290 || 00:45:00.300 || but I'll tell you one thing
00:45:02.270 || 00:45:02.280 || um I could see that really gaining
00:45:05.630 || 00:45:05.640 || popularity if we move to a central bank
00:45:09.349 || 00:45:09.359 || digital currency system where you're in
00:45:12.230 || 00:45:12.240 || essence talking about you know using
00:45:15.410 || 00:45:15.420 || gold in favor of uh in favor of of the
00:45:17.809 || 00:45:17.819 || Central Bank digital currency
00:45:20.210 || 00:45:20.220 || um I haven't but it wouldn't surprise me
00:45:23.270 || 00:45:23.280 || uh there and I probably is Utah if I had
00:45:25.210 || 00:45:25.220 || to guess would be my guest I don't know
00:45:28.250 || 00:45:28.260 || but uh look you know
00:45:30.290 || 00:45:30.300 || um gold and silver are money their
00:45:32.690 || 00:45:32.700 || wealth they've I'm sure these are laws
00:45:34.670 || 00:45:34.680 || that go way back
00:45:37.910 || 00:45:37.920 || um because it's it's been money it is
00:45:40.430 || 00:45:40.440 || money uh it will always be money long
00:45:43.490 || 00:45:43.500 || after this first run of whatever Central
00:45:46.069 || 00:45:46.079 || Bank digital dollar probably goes by the
00:45:48.950 || 00:45:48.960 || wayside as well so look uh I haven't
00:45:52.130 || 00:45:52.140 || heard about it but these are some of the
00:45:54.050 || 00:45:54.060 || things that you never know these are the
00:45:55.970 || 00:45:55.980 || things that could pop up where you just
00:45:59.809 || 00:45:59.819 || never know oftentimes we have a plan and
00:46:03.950 || 00:46:03.960 || that plan changes as things unfold and
00:46:05.870 || 00:46:05.880 || if anything I've learned over the last
00:46:08.030 || 00:46:08.040 || three years is that anything can happen
00:46:10.550 || 00:46:10.560 || anything anything can happen and maybe
00:46:13.250 || 00:46:13.260 || even an attempt to take back our our
00:46:15.470 || 00:46:15.480 || constitution to take back our our
00:46:17.510 || 00:46:17.520 || Liberty to take back our currency to
00:46:19.609 || 00:46:19.619 || take back our country maybe that happens
00:46:22.670 || 00:46:22.680 || in a very peaceful
00:46:26.750 || 00:46:26.760 || um way where we use sound money as the
00:46:28.970 || 00:46:28.980 || springboard to you know
00:46:32.329 || 00:46:32.339 || pull us up from from our bootstraps
00:46:35.450 || 00:46:35.460 || um from from a from a country that is
00:46:38.210 || 00:46:38.220 || massively indebted and a currency that
00:46:41.030 || 00:46:41.040 || has been eviscerated in terms of its
00:46:44.450 || 00:46:44.460 || value and you know be nice to use sound
00:46:46.790 || 00:46:46.800 || money again and and maybe the people who
00:46:49.550 || 00:46:49.560 || have had enough insight to purchase
00:46:51.410 || 00:46:51.420 || precious metals before this happens will
00:46:53.569 || 00:46:53.579 || actually be able to keep it when we see
00:46:55.670 || 00:46:55.680 || this gold revaluation which I think is
00:46:56.990 || 00:46:57.000 || coming
00:46:59.450 || 00:46:59.460 || um and maybe that explains the massive
00:47:01.970 || 00:47:01.980 || drawdown of Supply off of the exchanges
00:47:04.730 || 00:47:04.740 || the big money knows the relevance of
00:47:06.650 || 00:47:06.660 || being positioned in gold and silver
00:47:09.530 || 00:47:09.540 || before we see any type of revaluation
00:47:12.490 || 00:47:12.500 || that the Dutch uh the Dutch
00:47:14.930 || 00:47:14.940 || governor of their Central Bank said hey
00:47:16.609 || 00:47:16.619 || this is the key to all the central banks
00:47:19.730 || 00:47:19.740 || becoming solvent is to revalue Gold to
00:47:22.309 || 00:47:22.319 || get their balance sheets whole well look
00:47:24.170 || 00:47:24.180 || people will say well Roosevelt
00:47:25.970 || 00:47:25.980 || confiscated gold there he is right over
00:47:27.950 || 00:47:27.960 || your shoulder yeah he did
00:47:31.550 || 00:47:31.560 || but everyone owned it and it was legal
00:47:33.530 || 00:47:33.540 || tender now is it really worth the
00:47:35.990 || 00:47:36.000 || backlash to go and grab the ETFs be
00:47:38.150 || 00:47:38.160 || sitting on all they need and the little
00:47:39.829 || 00:47:39.839 || guys who own gold and silver they can
00:47:41.630 || 00:47:41.640 || keep it when they sell they'll go back
00:47:44.750 || 00:47:44.760 || into the cbdc realm I just don't see
00:47:46.790 || 00:47:46.800 || gold confiscation but I've seen who
00:47:49.069 || 00:47:49.079 || knows maybe there will be things that
00:47:51.710 || 00:47:51.720 || unfold that we can't see where if you
00:47:54.290 || 00:47:54.300 || were smart enough to accumulate gold and
00:47:56.450 || 00:47:56.460 || silver as as wealth okay it's not an
00:47:59.150 || 00:47:59.160 || investment more so now than ever I
00:48:01.490 || 00:48:01.500 || always say this little buzz phrase it's
00:48:03.290 || 00:48:03.300 || outlived two world wars German
00:48:05.030 || 00:48:05.040 || hyperinflation and the Great Depression
00:48:07.730 || 00:48:07.740 || and every pandemic it has and maybe it
00:48:11.030 || 00:48:11.040 || will outlive another dollar revaluation
00:48:16.790 || 00:48:16.800 || uh or gold revaluation or or or maybe a
00:48:20.030 || 00:48:20.040 || a global revaluation or or maybe a new
00:48:23.150 || 00:48:23.160 || world Reserve standard or whatever it is
00:48:25.190 || 00:48:25.200 || I think it's never been more important
00:48:27.230 || 00:48:27.240 || to own precious metals and if they take
00:48:30.530 || 00:48:30.540 || it from us okay if they do
00:48:32.870 || 00:48:32.880 || eminent domain says they have to pay you
00:48:35.930 || 00:48:35.940 || something fair for it so yeah it would
00:48:38.390 || 00:48:38.400 || suck it really would man it could happen
00:48:40.370 || 00:48:40.380 || right I'd be lying if I said otherwise
00:48:42.050 || 00:48:42.060 || desperate governments do desperate
00:48:44.630 || 00:48:44.640 || things I don't think it will happen I
00:48:46.910 || 00:48:46.920 || think the ETFs will lead the way
00:48:49.550 || 00:48:49.560 || but um you hope for the best to prepare
00:48:51.290 || 00:48:51.300 || for the worst and maybe it affords us
00:48:53.450 || 00:48:53.460 || opportunities or possibilities that we
00:48:55.730 || 00:48:55.740 || don't even see on the horizon right now
00:48:58.730 || 00:48:58.740 || I've got an actual story from uh last
00:49:01.430 || 00:49:01.440 || week I got a call from an attorney and
00:49:02.569 || 00:49:02.579 || it's about
00:49:04.730 || 00:49:04.740 || about using gold to settle a contract
00:49:06.349 || 00:49:06.359 || and I forgot that about until just now
00:49:07.730 || 00:49:07.740 || we were talking about it but I just
00:49:08.870 || 00:49:08.880 || remembered we're getting late in the
00:49:10.130 || 00:49:10.140 || hour and I want to give you a chance to
00:49:12.470 || 00:49:12.480 || talk about our special so I'll give you
00:49:13.609 || 00:49:13.619 || a chance right now to talk about the
00:49:16.010 || 00:49:16.020 || special and show pictures of that and
00:49:17.329 || 00:49:17.339 || then I'll tell the story about the
00:49:18.770 || 00:49:18.780 || attorney who called me in about the gold
00:49:21.230 || 00:49:21.240 || contract yeah real quick last week we
00:49:23.690 || 00:49:23.700 || offered the 20 gold pieces and I will
00:49:26.390 || 00:49:26.400 || tell everyone out there for 33 years
00:49:28.309 || 00:49:28.319 || I've bought gold and silver every two
00:49:30.530 || 00:49:30.540 || weeks there is nothing that I like
00:49:33.470 || 00:49:33.480 || better in Gold than the pre-33 20 roll
00:49:34.730 || 00:49:34.740 || pieces
00:49:37.430 || 00:49:37.440 || they're amazing in every way they
00:49:40.150 || 00:49:40.160 || they're a piece of Americana they're
00:49:43.370 || 00:49:43.380 || historical they're basically an ounce of
00:49:46.309 || 00:49:46.319 || gold they're beautiful they tell a story
00:49:49.010 || 00:49:49.020 || they speak to you almost especially the
00:49:51.010 || 00:49:51.020 || circulated ones from the early or
00:49:54.170 || 00:49:54.180 || mid-1800s you just wonder where was this
00:49:56.210 || 00:49:56.220 || coin 150 years ago
00:49:58.910 || 00:49:58.920 || we still have some of those left and uh
00:50:00.890 || 00:50:00.900 || we'll try to keep the prices pretty much
00:50:04.490 || 00:50:04.500 || where they were over the last week so if
00:50:07.069 || 00:50:07.079 || anyone is looking for gold give us a
00:50:10.730 || 00:50:10.740 || call or send an email on those uh 20 dog
00:50:12.950 || 00:50:12.960 || world pieces that we had from last week
00:50:14.990 || 00:50:15.000 || you'll you won't be sorry that you did
00:50:17.030 || 00:50:17.040 || our prices would be really good and if
00:50:18.650 || 00:50:18.660 || you're going to buy gold it's a thing to
00:50:20.030 || 00:50:20.040 || buy
00:50:23.089 || 00:50:23.099 || um in terms of this week once again look
00:50:26.390 || 00:50:26.400 || as much as I love gold as much as I
00:50:28.370 || 00:50:28.380 || believe when the Music Stops you want to
00:50:30.650 || 00:50:30.660 || be in Gold because it's the only other
00:50:33.109 || 00:50:33.119 || tier one Reserve asset because the
00:50:35.030 || 00:50:35.040 || central banks have loaded up on it more
00:50:38.930 || 00:50:38.940 || than at any time since 1974 because the
00:50:41.210 || 00:50:41.220 || withdrawals to the brics Nations just in
00:50:43.870 || 00:50:43.880 || the third quarter alone amount to over
00:50:48.770 || 00:50:48.780 || 400 tons of gold double almost the
00:50:56.990 || 00:50:57.000 || gold is is is the place to be in my
00:51:00.349 || 00:51:00.359 || opinion when the Music Stops but I can't
00:51:03.770 || 00:51:03.780 || look past the ability to get much more
00:51:06.109 || 00:51:06.119 || gold by buying silver which is the most
00:51:08.930 || 00:51:08.940 || undervalued asset on the planet
00:51:11.270 || 00:51:11.280 || um and the relationship between the two
00:51:13.069 || 00:51:13.079 || affords such
00:51:15.650 || 00:51:15.660 || an opportunity once in a generation
00:51:19.849 || 00:51:19.859 || opportunity where you see a nearly 80 to
00:51:21.230 || 00:51:21.240 || 1 ratio
00:51:25.190 || 00:51:25.200 || between the two which is historically so
00:51:27.049 || 00:51:27.059 || far out of whack in terms of its price
00:51:29.329 || 00:51:29.339 || relationship to gold and its geologic
00:51:30.950 || 00:51:30.960 || relationship to gold
00:51:35.329 || 00:51:35.339 || and it's utility what is used for in an
00:51:37.250 || 00:51:37.260 || expansive green and digital applications
00:51:40.250 || 00:51:40.260 || the need for silver is extraordinary and
00:51:43.549 || 00:51:43.559 || I just can't help but continue to pound
00:51:46.910 || 00:51:46.920 || the table of the virtues of silver and
00:51:49.670 || 00:51:49.680 || the ability to buy it at this ratio and
00:51:51.950 || 00:51:51.960 || when it corrects in its relationship to
00:51:54.710 || 00:51:54.720 || Gold consider making that trade
00:51:58.309 || 00:51:58.319 || I think a double is easy where 42 to 1
00:52:01.370 || 00:52:01.380 || represents its 200 year average where we
00:52:03.170 || 00:52:03.180 || are right now if it just hits its
00:52:05.089 || 00:52:05.099 || average of where it's been priced in its
00:52:08.690 || 00:52:08.700 || relationship to to gold it's a double or
00:52:10.670 || 00:52:10.680 || damn near or near it and it's coming out
00:52:15.049 || 00:52:15.059 || of the ground at seven to one we're ten
00:52:17.809 || 00:52:17.819 || times 11 times over that right now it's
00:52:20.030 || 00:52:20.040 || just too good to ignore so we're gonna
00:52:24.589 || 00:52:24.599 || go with the back date and 2022 silver
00:52:28.309 || 00:52:28.319 || maple leaves and um the back date silver
00:52:29.870 || 00:52:29.880 || made beliefs would be any date other
00:52:32.809 || 00:52:32.819 || than 2022. we don't have the 2023s in
00:52:34.730 || 00:52:34.740 || the Maple Leafs yet those will be six
00:52:37.130 || 00:52:37.140 || dollars and five cents over the price of
00:52:38.690 || 00:52:38.700 || silver and they come in sealed mint
00:52:41.569 || 00:52:41.579 || boxes and tubes at 25 we do have quite a
00:52:43.210 || 00:52:43.220 || few of the sealed mint boxes available
00:52:46.670 || 00:52:46.680 || and then the 2022s at six and a quarter
00:52:49.910 || 00:52:49.920 || over same thing sealed mint boxes tubes
00:52:53.030 || 00:52:53.040 || of 25 pure silver coin in the world four
00:52:56.210 || 00:52:56.220 || nines nine nine nine nine you can see on
00:52:58.790 || 00:52:58.800 || the second from right going there four
00:53:01.089 || 00:53:01.099 || nines pure
00:53:04.609 || 00:53:04.619 || in in terms of silver coins it's as good
00:53:08.569 || 00:53:08.579 || as it gets and uh you know it just
00:53:10.309 || 00:53:10.319 || hasn't been easy to continue to bring
00:53:13.010 || 00:53:13.020 || specials I wanted to get some gold out
00:53:15.829 || 00:53:15.839 || there last last week because those are
00:53:17.750 || 00:53:17.760 || so special to me but
00:53:19.670 || 00:53:19.680 || the truth be told I don't think there's
00:53:21.710 || 00:53:21.720 || a better investment on the planet and I
00:53:23.690 || 00:53:23.700 || don't sell Metals as an investment to me
00:53:25.910 || 00:53:25.920 || I sell them as wealth I say that all the
00:53:28.069 || 00:53:28.079 || time but silver truly is an investment
00:53:30.970 || 00:53:30.980 || in every way it offers
00:53:33.170 || 00:53:33.180 || investment potential that you typically
00:53:35.990 || 00:53:36.000 || don't see especially in my industry so
00:53:37.370 || 00:53:37.380 || we're going to go with the maples this
00:53:39.710 || 00:53:39.720 || week and still have some of the gold
00:53:43.010 || 00:53:43.020 || available but uh looking for coins it's
00:53:45.530 || 00:53:45.540 || just it's it's as good of a buy as we've
00:53:47.150 || 00:53:47.160 || seen on Silver Maple Leafs in the last
00:53:48.770 || 00:53:48.780 || year
00:53:52.130 || 00:53:52.140 || thanks for that and everybody uh if you

00:54:13.549 || 00:54:13.559 || you won't miss that
00:54:15.410 || 00:54:15.420 || um I promise to tell you the story and
00:54:17.210 || 00:54:17.220 || it came back to me Andy about the
00:54:19.130 || 00:54:19.140 || attorney who called me I got this phone
00:54:22.490 || 00:54:22.500 || call and the person said okay
00:54:26.870 || 00:54:26.880 || I work for a client who's trying to buy
00:54:30.290 || 00:54:30.300 || a business from uh another person who's
00:54:31.549 || 00:54:31.559 || selling the business but the person
00:54:33.349 || 00:54:33.359 || selling the business wants has set the
00:54:35.089 || 00:54:35.099 || price but they don't want to be paid in
00:54:36.710 || 00:54:36.720 || cash they want to be paid in gold and
00:54:38.569 || 00:54:38.579 || they said that I should call you and ask
00:54:40.730 || 00:54:40.740 || you how much gold they could get uh in
00:54:42.470 || 00:54:42.480 || one ounce form that would fulfill that
00:54:44.630 || 00:54:44.640 || price and that the purchaser of their
00:54:46.010 || 00:54:46.020 || business who's going to agree to buy
00:54:48.770 || 00:54:48.780 || their business can pay it all up front
00:54:51.049 || 00:54:51.059 || or they can pay it in installments over
00:54:54.650 || 00:54:54.660 || a five-year period but it's got to be uh
00:54:56.809 || 00:54:56.819 || that same number of ounces of gold and
00:54:58.190 || 00:54:58.200 || so they can pay it now or pay it later
00:55:01.069 || 00:55:01.079 || it's up to them uh in installments and
00:55:03.049 || 00:55:03.059 || so I quoted him what the current price
00:55:05.150 || 00:55:05.160 || would have been for that that dollar
00:55:06.770 || 00:55:06.780 || value worth of gold it was a very
00:55:09.770 || 00:55:09.780 || significant uh quantity and they said
00:55:11.150 || 00:55:11.160 || thank you very much that'll help me we
00:55:12.650 || 00:55:12.660 || can write this up now now we know how to
00:55:14.450 || 00:55:14.460 || write up the the contract for the
00:55:16.130 || 00:55:16.140 || purchase of his business so I just
00:55:17.809 || 00:55:17.819 || remembered I was just involved with this
00:55:20.569 || 00:55:20.579 || uh just in the last week or two which is
00:55:23.569 || 00:55:23.579 || a creation of a contract to buy a
00:55:25.849 || 00:55:25.859 || business where the dollar value of the
00:55:28.190 || 00:55:28.200 || business is being declared but the
00:55:30.770 || 00:55:30.780 || payment must be paid in physical gold
00:55:33.650 || 00:55:33.660 || and the reason that the seller isn't
00:55:35.450 || 00:55:35.460 || sweating whether they pay up front or
00:55:36.770 || 00:55:36.780 || whether they pay over a period of time
00:55:38.170 || 00:55:38.180 || is because he knows he's going to get
00:55:41.329 || 00:55:41.339 || his gold and it may be worth a lot more
00:55:42.829 || 00:55:42.839 || later so maybe they'll be in their best
00:55:45.530 || 00:55:45.540 || interest to to buy it sooner than later
00:55:47.930 || 00:55:47.940 || it's really interesting and I think I'm
00:55:49.430 || 00:55:49.440 || just thinking outside the box so I could
00:55:51.829 || 00:55:51.839 || be way off base on this but maybe they
00:55:54.410 || 00:55:54.420 || allow this or maybe it's on the books or
00:55:57.349 || 00:55:57.359 || maybe it just makes sense to me similar
00:56:01.730 || 00:56:01.740 || to why gold is not would not be part of
00:56:04.849 || 00:56:04.859 || probate in in the state even if it were
00:56:06.290 || 00:56:06.300 || declared in the state there would be no
00:56:07.910 || 00:56:07.920 || probate because you know exactly what
00:56:09.950 || 00:56:09.960 || it's worth an ounce of gold is an ounce
00:56:12.109 || 00:56:12.119 || of gold wherever it is so you know what
00:56:13.910 || 00:56:13.920 || it's worth at the day someone passed
00:56:16.609 || 00:56:16.619 || away and in this case
00:56:18.290 || 00:56:18.300 || um you know I'm thinking well what if
00:56:20.030 || 00:56:20.040 || you traded a baseball card collection
00:56:21.710 || 00:56:21.720 || for a business and it's you know it's
00:56:23.270 || 00:56:23.280 || worth millions of dollars well it's
00:56:26.390 || 00:56:26.400 || somewhat subjective so in terms of
00:56:28.790 || 00:56:28.800 || evaluation the IRS might have a problem
00:56:30.290 || 00:56:30.300 || with that
00:56:33.230 || 00:56:33.240 || um but when you talk about gold it is
00:56:35.630 || 00:56:35.640 || not subjective and if you're buying one
00:56:37.910 || 00:56:37.920 || ounce bullion bars or kilo bars of gold
00:56:41.589 || 00:56:41.599 || or whatever you're buying it is
00:56:44.390 || 00:56:44.400 || standardized so it does make sense I
00:56:46.190 || 00:56:46.200 || don't know how it all play out in terms
00:56:48.109 || 00:56:48.119 || of taxes and Reporting and this kind of
00:56:50.510 || 00:56:50.520 || stuff it's quite intriguing uh it
00:56:53.329 || 00:56:53.339 || doesn't surprise me quite frankly and I
00:56:55.010 || 00:56:55.020 || think the the business owner who's
00:56:57.370 || 00:56:57.380 || selling the business is one shrew
00:57:00.290 || 00:57:00.300 || because the likelihood of the dollars
00:57:02.569 || 00:57:02.579 || that they receive depreciating and value
00:57:06.109 || 00:57:06.119 || over that time period is tremendous it's
00:57:09.530 || 00:57:09.540 || guaranteed uh whereas you know the gold
00:57:13.490 || 00:57:13.500 || won't and so at least in theory anyways
00:57:15.890 || 00:57:15.900 || it will retain its purchasing power as
00:57:18.770 || 00:57:18.780 || the dollar right now is losing if you
00:57:20.690 || 00:57:20.700 || believe the numbers that we hear out of
00:57:23.990 || 00:57:24.000 || the of the FED it's losing what six or
00:57:27.349 || 00:57:27.359 || seven percent uh per year and we know
00:57:29.569 || 00:57:29.579 || those numbers are not really true so
00:57:31.790 || 00:57:31.800 || anyways bottom line is I think it's it's
00:57:34.190 || 00:57:34.200 || cool it's it's a good idea and it it
00:57:37.490 || 00:57:37.500 || speaks to the virtues of of gold and
00:57:39.589 || 00:57:39.599 || probably why part of the reason why it's
00:57:42.770 || 00:57:42.780 || been viewed as wealth or as money
00:57:45.589 || 00:57:45.599 || since Biblical times yeah I just uh
00:57:47.329 || 00:57:47.339 || finished interviewing Michael Pento
00:57:48.349 || 00:57:48.359 || today that's going to be coming up
00:57:50.510 || 00:57:50.520 || really soon folks uh he was talking
00:57:52.730 || 00:57:52.740 || really about by the way I like yeah he
00:57:54.589 || 00:57:54.599 || was saying as you said the the Fed was
00:57:57.890 || 00:57:57.900 || admitting uh you know close to 10 uh
00:57:59.930 || 00:57:59.940 || inflation nine percent whatever over the
00:58:01.309 || 00:58:01.319 || past a couple of quarters or whatever
00:58:04.069 || 00:58:04.079 || but he said that it figured the way it's
00:58:05.390 || 00:58:05.400 || supposed to be figured according to John
00:58:07.069 || 00:58:07.079 || Williams the shadowstaff.com I said it
00:58:09.890 || 00:58:09.900 || was more like 20 for the past couple of
00:58:11.270 || 00:58:11.280 || quarters so
00:58:14.329 || 00:58:14.339 || um anyway that's what's happening I went
00:58:17.089 || 00:58:17.099 || just to give you an idea I mean it's so
00:58:20.150 || 00:58:20.160 || crazy man I went to uh visit my son in
00:58:23.210 || 00:58:23.220 || New York City this weekend and I went to
00:58:24.829 || 00:58:24.839 || a restaurant everyone told me I had to
00:58:28.030 || 00:58:28.040 || go to it was called Carbone amazing food
00:58:32.930 || 00:58:32.940 || it was nothing lavish it was a very old
00:58:34.790 || 00:58:34.800 || Italian restaurant that everyone said
00:58:36.470 || 00:58:36.480 || he'd have to go to
00:58:39.410 || 00:58:39.420 || and I visited my son he's uh he's an
00:58:42.349 || 00:58:42.359 || adult he's 22 years old and we had a
00:58:44.450 || 00:58:44.460 || couple of Manhattans while in Manhattan
00:58:47.270 || 00:58:47.280 || right and uh my wife and one of my
00:58:49.609 || 00:58:49.619 || daughters and the dinner was eight
00:58:51.770 || 00:58:51.780 || hundred dollars I almost fell out of my
00:58:54.829 || 00:58:54.839 || chair literally fell out of my chair
00:58:55.490 || 00:58:55.500 || um
00:58:58.309 || 00:58:58.319 || when I came home from
00:59:00.950 || 00:59:00.960 || to the airport LaGuardia Airport
00:59:03.349 || 00:59:03.359 || uh the Vikings game I'm big Minnesota
00:59:06.049 || 00:59:06.059 || Vikings fan was on at the bar right next
00:59:07.730 || 00:59:07.740 || to our gate
00:59:10.970 || 00:59:10.980 || against the Jets got some time thought
00:59:12.589 || 00:59:12.599 || I'd have a beer
00:59:16.549 || 00:59:16.559 || 23 later for a beer at LaGuardia Airport
00:59:19.630 || 00:59:19.640 || mind you it was a pint it was 23 bucks
00:59:23.089 || 00:59:23.099 || and I mean anyone telling me that
00:59:26.030 || 00:59:26.040 || inflation is not off the charts is not
00:59:28.309 || 00:59:28.319 || spending any time in Manhattan I'll tell
00:59:33.349 || 00:59:33.359 || you that much a cab from the airport to
00:59:37.130 || 00:59:37.140 || um to the hotel which was
00:59:41.030 || 00:59:41.040 || 12 miles was almost 60 dollars so I
00:59:43.010 || 00:59:43.020 || don't know how anyone any young person
00:59:45.589 || 00:59:45.599 || anyway my son's apartment has two
00:59:49.069 || 00:59:49.079 || roommates tiny little Cracker Jack itty
00:59:52.849 || 00:59:52.859 || bitty shoe boxes almost 8 000 bucks
00:59:56.210 || 00:59:56.220 || a year I mean a month so I don't know
00:59:57.770 || 00:59:57.780 || it's uh
01:00:01.490 || 01:00:01.500 || there is inflation and it's bad so I
01:00:03.349 || 01:00:03.359 || think that it's not getting any better
01:00:05.270 || 01:00:05.280 || anytime soon certainly the government
01:00:07.670 || 01:00:07.680 || has a vested interest in having us all
01:00:10.130 || 01:00:10.140 || believe that it's better than it is but
01:00:12.890 || 01:00:12.900 || owning gold is a way to protect yourself
01:00:14.809 || 01:00:14.819 || especially over an extended period of
