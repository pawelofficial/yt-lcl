00:01:59.090 || 00:01:59.100 || person at the Liberty Mastermind

00:02:10.490 || 00:02:10.500 || you've got a free video blog you put out
00:02:14.089 || 00:02:14.099 || twice a day and in in the midday updates
00:02:16.190 || 00:02:16.200 || when there what is necessary and the
00:02:17.390 || 00:02:17.400 || weekend report and that sort of thing
00:02:18.710 || 00:02:18.720 || we'll talk about more about people who
00:02:20.089 || 00:02:20.099 || how they can sign up for that at the end
00:02:22.010 || 00:02:22.020 || but you've been writing a lot recently
00:02:23.869 || 00:02:23.879 || about instability in the debt market and
00:02:25.430 || 00:02:25.440 || I thought it was fascinating my wife
00:02:26.809 || 00:02:26.819 || just read me a story yesterday about
00:02:29.650 || 00:02:29.660 || leaders in the FDIC
00:02:32.150 || 00:02:32.160 || speaking into the microphone at their
00:02:34.369 || 00:02:34.379 || major meetings talking about let's
00:02:38.390 || 00:02:38.400 || inform major money managers about risks
00:02:40.369 || 00:02:40.379 || to the banking system but let's not
00:02:42.410 || 00:02:42.420 || let's not get carried away on that and
00:02:43.790 || 00:02:43.800 || inform the public because you wouldn't
00:02:46.130 || 00:02:46.140 || want unintended consequences they said
00:02:48.470 || 00:02:48.480 || we need to have the public having
00:02:50.809 || 00:02:50.819 || confidence in the banking system so can
00:02:52.490 || 00:02:52.500 || you pull back back the veil on that and
00:02:54.290 || 00:02:54.300 || tell us what's really going on in the
00:02:55.970 || 00:02:55.980 || debt market and how what it implies
00:02:57.940 || 00:02:57.950 || about risk in the banking sector
00:03:04.309 || 00:03:04.319 || absolutely look uh what I've been
00:03:06.530 || 00:03:06.540 || telling people for years is you know
00:03:08.030 || 00:03:08.040 || this this whole thing it's it's it's
00:03:10.610 || 00:03:10.620 || it's all fake it's all phony it's all
00:03:12.290 || 00:03:12.300 || propped up it's not on the elemental
00:03:15.290 || 00:03:15.300 || chart uh this debt-based economic model
00:03:19.550 || 00:03:19.560 || that we have uh you know it's uh it just
00:03:23.270 || 00:03:23.280 || it's it's not real none of it is real
00:03:26.869 || 00:03:26.879 || and um the the backbone of this whole
00:03:30.350 || 00:03:30.360 || thing is uh you know sensual Banks
00:03:33.229 || 00:03:33.239 || keeping all this propped up by issuing
00:03:34.910 || 00:03:34.920 || debt through one door buying it back
00:03:37.250 || 00:03:37.260 || through another door uh it's it's a
00:03:38.990 || 00:03:39.000 || Ponzi scheme it every sense to the word
00:03:43.009 || 00:03:43.019 || uh and without vastly vastly inflating
00:03:46.309 || 00:03:46.319 || the debt the global debt it this whole
00:03:48.350 || 00:03:48.360 || thing comes crashing down and it's going
00:03:50.930 || 00:03:50.940 || to we all know that I think you and me
00:03:52.670 || 00:03:52.680 || our followers have been prepared for
00:03:54.350 || 00:03:54.360 || this for quite a while but central banks
00:03:57.470 || 00:03:57.480 || aren't done they're not done inflating
00:03:59.690 || 00:03:59.700 || they're not done not done trying to
00:04:01.490 || 00:04:01.500 || fulfill their end game to be the lenders
00:04:03.410 || 00:04:03.420 || and buyers of the last resort that
00:04:07.250 || 00:04:07.260 || trying to keep the resemblance or or the
00:04:09.830 || 00:04:09.840 || illusion is probably a better word of
00:04:12.289 || 00:04:12.299 || stability here in the markets in the
00:04:14.570 || 00:04:14.580 || debt Market which is a time bomb it's a
00:04:16.310 || 00:04:16.320 || ticking Time Bomb it's ticking louder
00:04:20.449 || 00:04:20.459 || it's ticking faster it's going to go off
00:04:22.790 || 00:04:22.800 || um we witnessed over the last a few
00:04:25.550 || 00:04:25.560 || months some pretty profound
00:04:27.890 || 00:04:27.900 || um in our face instability here in the
00:04:30.710 || 00:04:30.720 || debt Market which which uh was it we
00:04:32.450 || 00:04:32.460 || were all able to see with the gyrating
00:04:34.670 || 00:04:34.680 || bond yields globally and then what
00:04:37.189 || 00:04:37.199 || happened we watched the mmri course 300
00:04:39.830 || 00:04:39.840 || manorino Market risk indicator free to
00:04:41.230 || 00:04:41.240 || everybody it's on my website
00:04:43.790 || 00:04:43.800 || traderschoice.net uh and then all of a
00:04:46.909 || 00:04:46.919 || sudden action was taken by uh the
00:04:49.790 || 00:04:49.800 || essential Banks to buy more debt uh mmri
00:04:53.330 || 00:04:53.340 || came down uh some stability came back to
00:04:55.870 || 00:04:55.880 || the debt Market the stocks did gain
00:04:58.790 || 00:04:58.800 || after that and now we're witnessing an
00:05:00.469 || 00:05:00.479 || interesting phenomenon and I've been
00:05:02.090 || 00:05:02.100 || talking about this since the end of last
00:05:05.210 || 00:05:05.220 || year Watching The this the global bond
00:05:07.249 || 00:05:07.259 || yields rise and then I kept saying I
00:05:08.210 || 00:05:08.220 || don't think they're done they're going
00:05:09.469 || 00:05:09.479 || to do something then all of a sudden
00:05:10.790 || 00:05:10.800 || right here at the beginning of the year
00:05:13.070 || 00:05:13.080 || what happened overnight was epic we
00:05:16.129 || 00:05:16.139 || watched Global bond yields drop the
00:05:18.170 || 00:05:18.180 || 10-year yield drop what does that mean
00:05:21.230 || 00:05:21.240 || some some some entities out here central
00:05:23.990 || 00:05:24.000 || banks hello are out here buying more
00:05:25.909 || 00:05:25.919 || debt just like we knew they would
00:05:27.529 || 00:05:27.539 || they're going to continue to do this
00:05:30.830 || 00:05:30.840 || they're not going to stop until they've
00:05:33.590 || 00:05:33.600 || finished at least fulfilled their their
00:05:35.570 || 00:05:35.580 || plan here to to create more people
00:05:37.370 || 00:05:37.380 || dependent on the current system or
00:05:39.110 || 00:05:39.120 || slaves to the system as I have been
00:05:40.550 || 00:05:40.560 || saying here
00:05:42.170 || 00:05:42.180 || um that's the environment they need to
00:05:44.330 || 00:05:44.340 || get more people dependent on it so when
00:05:45.170 || 00:05:45.180 || they
00:05:47.749 || 00:05:47.759 || the issue in their new system and allow
00:05:50.210 || 00:05:50.220 || this one allow by designing this system
00:05:52.189 || 00:05:52.199 || to melt down they say hey we have a
00:05:54.650 || 00:05:54.660 || solution for you yes we do and now
00:05:55.670 || 00:05:55.680 || they're going to issue in their new
00:05:56.689 || 00:05:56.699 || system
00:05:59.150 || 00:05:59.160 || I just had a conversation with a client
00:06:01.129 || 00:06:01.139 || interested in obtaining physical
00:06:04.550 || 00:06:04.560 || precious metals today asking is this a
00:06:07.850 || 00:06:07.860 || safe time to put my nest egg into a
00:06:09.950 || 00:06:09.960 || one-year certificate of deposit in a
00:06:12.590 || 00:06:12.600 || bank another one uh yesterday asking me
00:06:13.850 || 00:06:13.860 || the same question about multi-year
00:06:15.830 || 00:06:15.840 || certificates of deposit in the banking
00:06:17.390 || 00:06:17.400 || system so they're trying he's and they
00:06:19.490 || 00:06:19.500 || they use this exact wording to just get
00:06:21.529 || 00:06:21.539 || out of the way until the dust settles
00:06:23.270 || 00:06:23.280 || and it reminded me of when I was in high
00:06:26.809 || 00:06:26.819 || school and all these newspaper headlines
00:06:28.790 || 00:06:28.800 || day after day after day about shelling
00:06:30.050 || 00:06:30.060 || and shelling and shelling in Beirut
00:06:32.029 || 00:06:32.039 || Lebanon is what comes to mind and I'm
00:06:33.650 || 00:06:33.660 || thinking about that's like parking your
00:06:36.290 || 00:06:36.300 || Cadillac in the middle of uh Beirut in
00:06:37.730 || 00:06:37.740 || the late 70s and thinking you're gonna
00:06:40.070 || 00:06:40.080 || wait for the dust to settle uh that's my
00:06:41.570 || 00:06:41.580 || that's the impression that came to me
00:06:42.890 || 00:06:42.900 || can you talk to us about the
00:06:44.930 || 00:06:44.940 || implications on an ordinary person of
00:06:46.670 || 00:06:46.680 || what you've been discussing which is
00:06:49.129 || 00:06:49.139 || strains in the debt market and what that
00:06:51.170 || 00:06:51.180 || implies as far as risks in the banking
00:06:52.129 || 00:06:52.139 || sector
00:06:54.590 || 00:06:54.600 || well you know look like I said this
00:06:56.870 || 00:06:56.880 || whole system is dead based we will get
00:06:58.370 || 00:06:58.380 || an implosion here in the debt Market
00:07:00.110 || 00:07:00.120 || it's going to implode and what does that
00:07:01.490 || 00:07:01.500 || actually mean it means a massive
00:07:03.650 || 00:07:03.660 || sell-off is coming an uncontrolled
00:07:06.529 || 00:07:06.539 || spiking in uh bond yields around the
00:07:08.809 || 00:07:08.819 || world and that's going to melt down and
00:07:10.610 || 00:07:10.620 || I mean I can't put this another way
00:07:14.210 || 00:07:14.220 || destroy uh the global Equity markets
00:07:16.670 || 00:07:16.680 || period the end what people are seem to
00:07:19.070 || 00:07:19.080 || be doing right now is Harding in cash
00:07:21.589 || 00:07:21.599 || okay like like this person you just
00:07:23.510 || 00:07:23.520 || suggested investing in debt or something
00:07:25.670 || 00:07:25.680 || along those lines here got to be nuts in
00:07:27.110 || 00:07:27.120 || my opinion
00:07:28.909 || 00:07:28.919 || um but but you know I could understand
00:07:31.430 || 00:07:31.440 || the thinking here a lot of people I mean
00:07:33.230 || 00:07:33.240 || there's a lot of bears here with regard
00:07:35.210 || 00:07:35.220 || to the market and this is the psychology
00:07:38.150 || 00:07:38.160 || of the market tells us the more bears
00:07:40.249 || 00:07:40.259 || that there are the more bullish we
00:07:43.010 || 00:07:43.020 || should become but you know look until we
00:07:44.290 || 00:07:44.300 || get
00:07:48.469 || 00:07:48.479 || the uh some real stability and we can't
00:07:50.749 || 00:07:50.759 || it's impossible in the debt Market which
00:07:52.909 || 00:07:52.919 || is you know not real it's all just
00:07:54.469 || 00:07:54.479 || propped up and it's continued to get
00:07:56.749 || 00:07:56.759 || that be that way you know I don't know I
00:07:58.430 || 00:07:58.440 || I can understand why people would want
00:08:00.830 || 00:08:00.840 || to get out of the uh out of the way
00:08:03.529 || 00:08:03.539 || quote unquote while this thing kind of
00:08:06.529 || 00:08:06.539 || normalizes here and you know to me
00:08:08.749 || 00:08:08.759 || watching the action of central banks
00:08:10.070 || 00:08:10.080 || it's very what they're doing is
00:08:12.589 || 00:08:12.599 || desperate obviously uh they're but at
00:08:14.089 || 00:08:14.099 || the same time they realize the current
00:08:15.890 || 00:08:15.900 || system is imploding it's imploding
00:08:18.230 || 00:08:18.240 || before our eyes we have a global economy
00:08:20.089 || 00:08:20.099 || which is Contracting it as fastest Pace
00:08:23.210 || 00:08:23.220 || ever uh people struggling to get by the
00:08:25.369 || 00:08:25.379 || this this phenomenon of rising inflation
00:08:27.170 || 00:08:27.180 || the Central Bank saying oh we got to
00:08:28.430 || 00:08:28.440 || raise rates because it's going to help
00:08:29.869 || 00:08:29.879 || the situation hasn't done the damn
00:08:32.089 || 00:08:32.099 || things never even meant to do it
00:08:33.529 || 00:08:33.539 || um they're going to continue to do so
00:08:35.329 || 00:08:35.339 || and then tell the lie that eventually
00:08:37.310 || 00:08:37.320 || one day a miracle is going to occur and
00:08:39.290 || 00:08:39.300 || inflation is going to come down no talk
00:08:40.850 || 00:08:40.860 || whatsoever about Contracting the money
00:08:43.490 || 00:08:43.500 || supply but uh look I can understand the
00:08:46.370 || 00:08:46.380 || situation is dire and the world economy
00:08:48.410 || 00:08:48.420 || is dire what are people going to do I
00:08:50.870 || 00:08:50.880 || mean I I still say the best thing to do
00:08:53.750 || 00:08:53.760 || and I can't imagine another way around
00:08:56.090 || 00:08:56.100 || it is to be betting against the debt
00:08:57.889 || 00:08:57.899 || becoming a world Central Bank holding
00:08:59.630 || 00:08:59.640 || hard assets physical silver my favorite
00:09:02.150 || 00:09:02.160 || asset of all time you know that gold
00:09:04.370 || 00:09:04.380 || probably my second Platinum Palladium as
00:09:06.829 || 00:09:06.839 || well I love them all I own them all
00:09:08.870 || 00:09:08.880 || um that's it I mean I think that's the
00:09:10.310 || 00:09:10.320 || perspective we have to look a little
00:09:12.170 || 00:09:12.180 || further down the road understanding
00:09:14.090 || 00:09:14.100 || where this is going to go eventually
00:09:15.769 || 00:09:15.779 || this is going to get very real for
00:09:18.110 || 00:09:18.120 || people unfortunately and
00:09:20.810 || 00:09:20.820 || it's it's much bigger than just a
00:09:22.910 || 00:09:22.920 || financial meltdown again this goes on to
00:09:25.009 || 00:09:25.019 || a resource problem which they're going
00:09:26.630 || 00:09:26.640 || to create allow to manifest itself
00:09:29.810 || 00:09:29.820 || shortages of food shortages of Water
00:09:31.850 || 00:09:31.860 || Resources all the stuff I've been
00:09:33.050 || 00:09:33.060 || talking about for many many years it's
00:09:34.550 || 00:09:34.560 || going to happen it's starting to already
00:09:37.130 || 00:09:37.140 || here uh and the lies the distractions
00:09:38.930 || 00:09:38.940 || the propaganda the look here's the don't
00:09:41.570 || 00:09:41.580 || look there via the mainstream media
00:09:43.910 || 00:09:43.920 || Outlets it's just getting worse and
00:09:45.530 || 00:09:45.540 || that's how you also know that things are
00:09:48.530 || 00:09:48.540 || are not uh so pretty yeah it's difficult
00:09:51.410 || 00:09:51.420 || for people including myself to separate
00:09:53.210 || 00:09:53.220 || you know you see signs of the times
00:09:56.090 || 00:09:56.100 || meaning like this distracting ignoring
00:09:57.889 || 00:09:57.899 || of the truth twisting of the truth into
00:10:00.230 || 00:10:00.240 || falsehoods and so on by mainstream media
00:10:02.630 || 00:10:02.640 || that sort of thing and you can see that
00:10:04.130 || 00:10:04.140 || as a sign of over nearing the end
00:10:05.870 || 00:10:05.880 || because that's a sign of desperation but
00:10:08.990 || 00:10:09.000 || also seems to become the current modus
00:10:12.410 || 00:10:12.420 || operandi of the mainstream media so does
00:10:14.090 || 00:10:14.100 || that mean yes we are in the late stage
00:10:16.550 || 00:10:16.560 || of an exhaustion stage of an Empire and
00:10:19.490 || 00:10:19.500 || of a fiat currency system is so but does
00:10:23.210 || 00:10:23.220 || that immediately signal imminence of the
00:10:26.090 || 00:10:26.100 || end or is that just possibly just signs
00:10:27.710 || 00:10:27.720 || of the last phase and that phase could
00:10:30.710 || 00:10:30.720 || go on for a protracted period of time
00:10:32.630 || 00:10:32.640 || well you know look I don't think we need
00:10:34.850 || 00:10:34.860 || to guess here we know we know what to
00:10:36.790 || 00:10:36.800 || look at I've been telling people I think
00:10:39.290 || 00:10:39.300 || since forever
00:10:41.090 || 00:10:41.100 || um and you know this to watch the bond
00:10:44.449 || 00:10:44.459 || market the the global bond market is the
00:10:48.530 || 00:10:48.540 || driver of the world financial system
00:10:52.069 || 00:10:52.079 || so by by watching What's Happening Here
00:10:56.530 || 00:10:56.540 || with regard to Global bond yields we can
00:11:00.290 || 00:11:00.300 || really zero in on what's going on when
00:11:03.650 || 00:11:03.660 || you see for example Global bonds uh
00:11:05.930 || 00:11:05.940 || selling off here okay that that that's
00:11:08.750 || 00:11:08.760 || that that's a problem uh and if you see
00:11:11.630 || 00:11:11.640 || the bond yields acting erratically going
00:11:13.850 || 00:11:13.860 || up and down and up and down and that's a
00:11:15.710 || 00:11:15.720 || sign of instability as well so what
00:11:17.269 || 00:11:17.279 || central banks have been doing here is
00:11:19.310 || 00:11:19.320 || trying to give that illusion of
00:11:20.750 || 00:11:20.760 || stability in the debt Market there
00:11:22.250 || 00:11:22.260 || they're on a mission to keep rates
00:11:24.350 || 00:11:24.360 || suppressed for as long as they possibly
00:11:25.850 || 00:11:25.860 || can and they're going to buy more and
00:11:27.230 || 00:11:27.240 || more just like I think I believe they're
00:11:28.730 || 00:11:28.740 || doing right now is the interface who
00:11:31.130 || 00:11:31.140 || else is buying all this debt it's not me
00:11:33.110 || 00:11:33.120 || it's not you I guarantee you it's not
00:11:35.150 || 00:11:35.160 || one of the people who follows your work
00:11:37.910 || 00:11:37.920 || all my work this is central banks so
00:11:39.410 || 00:11:39.420 || they're going to continue that illusion
00:11:41.569 || 00:11:41.579 || until they can't anymore and what's the
00:11:43.430 || 00:11:43.440 || side effect of what central banks are
00:11:45.410 || 00:11:45.420 || doing well it's skyrocketing inflation
00:11:47.449 || 00:11:47.459 || here by issuing that through one door
00:11:48.470 || 00:11:48.480 || buying it back to another this is
00:11:50.870 || 00:11:50.880 || massively inflationary you know people
00:11:52.610 || 00:11:52.620 || are not supposed to know these things
00:11:54.769 || 00:11:54.779 || these are all the part of the dark
00:11:56.569 || 00:11:56.579 || underbelly of the entire Financial
00:11:59.210 || 00:11:59.220 || system which has become my mission in
00:12:00.949 || 00:12:00.959 || life to expose
00:12:02.630 || 00:12:02.640 || um and I think between you and I we're
00:12:04.550 || 00:12:04.560 || you know we're doing it we're getting
00:12:06.290 || 00:12:06.300 || the message out there people are paying
00:12:09.050 || 00:12:09.060 || attention thank goodness honestly but
00:12:10.730 || 00:12:10.740 || this is why I've been telling people for
00:12:12.290 || 00:12:12.300 || like many many months they're not done
00:12:13.850 || 00:12:13.860 || they're not done they're not done I
00:12:17.350 || 00:12:17.360 || believe central banks are gonna continue
00:12:19.430 || 00:12:19.440 || to inflate
00:12:21.650 || 00:12:21.660 || um and that is and that is use their
00:12:23.930 || 00:12:23.940 || product which is debt which they issue
00:12:26.810 || 00:12:26.820 || to the world okay and buy assets with it
00:12:29.030 || 00:12:29.040 || they want to own it all they're on that
00:12:30.769 || 00:12:30.779 || mission to own it all so they're going
00:12:32.269 || 00:12:32.279 || to sell the lie to people that we're
00:12:33.470 || 00:12:33.480 || doing this and we're doing that but
00:12:35.509 || 00:12:35.519 || meanwhile look we have an economy that's
00:12:37.069 || 00:12:37.079 || creating around the world as I said
00:12:39.410 || 00:12:39.420 || people are suffering here can't they
00:12:40.910 || 00:12:40.920 || can't make against me personal debt
00:12:42.829 || 00:12:42.839 || household debt Consumer Debt uh
00:12:45.650 || 00:12:45.660 || skyrocketing the savings rate in the
00:12:47.210 || 00:12:47.220 || negative and going deeper into the
00:12:49.069 || 00:12:49.079 || negative here this isn't terrible
00:12:50.750 || 00:12:50.760 || environment for people they're being
00:12:52.610 || 00:12:52.620 || pushed to the lower rung of society as
00:12:54.470 || 00:12:54.480 || as I explained on my blog would happen
00:12:56.629 || 00:12:56.639 || from a decade ago the creation of a new
00:12:58.970 || 00:12:58.980 || feudal system here and a whole new
00:13:01.550 || 00:13:01.560 || paradigm a whole new set of rules and
00:13:04.129 || 00:13:04.139 || and central banks collectively are going
00:13:07.250 || 00:13:07.260 || to continue to push their own agenda
00:13:09.110 || 00:13:09.120 || they have their own best interest in
00:13:11.210 || 00:13:11.220 || mind period they don't give a damn about
00:13:12.889 || 00:13:12.899 || you me or anyone who follows all work
00:13:16.009 || 00:13:16.019 || they they are they are right now in the
00:13:19.069 || 00:13:19.079 || middle of trying to Foster this feudal
00:13:20.750 || 00:13:20.760 || system here extreme haves extreme
00:13:22.850 || 00:13:22.860 || have-nots creating more people that are
00:13:24.829 || 00:13:24.839 || dependent on the system that's really
00:13:27.290 || 00:13:27.300 || what's going on here so how long can it
00:13:29.569 || 00:13:29.579 || go I have no idea but oh but we have a
00:13:32.810 || 00:13:32.820 || clue by watching Global bond yields the
00:13:35.210 || 00:13:35.220 || relative strength of the dollar
00:13:37.069 || 00:13:37.079 || um or dollar demand however you want to
00:13:38.389 || 00:13:38.399 || look however you want to think about it
00:13:40.069 || 00:13:40.079 || in this environment and then and then
00:13:42.410 || 00:13:42.420 || the mmri manorino market risk indicator
00:13:45.769 || 00:13:45.779 || again this is I think it's the best risk
00:13:47.629 || 00:13:47.639 || indicator out there period the end I
00:13:49.190 || 00:13:49.200 || don't even know if I'm another one that
00:13:52.190 || 00:13:52.200 || exists it's a little brainchild of mine
00:13:55.310 || 00:13:55.320 || I came up with sometime last year it's
00:13:57.170 || 00:13:57.180 || uh it's a risk indicator that I think
00:13:58.190 || 00:13:58.200 || people need to start paying more
00:13:59.930 || 00:13:59.940 || attention to
00:14:01.730 || 00:14:01.740 || so that we don't miss the chance if
00:14:03.190 || 00:14:03.200 || people want to find that they go to
00:14:04.850 || 00:14:04.860 || traderschoice.net and they find it right
00:14:06.829 || 00:14:06.839 || right on top of the second page see it
00:14:08.750 || 00:14:08.760 || right there okay and that's a
00:14:11.329 || 00:14:11.339 || calculation it's a number that goes up
00:14:13.970 || 00:14:13.980 || by you know in different ranges uh green
00:14:17.150 || 00:14:17.160 || yellow orange red depending on Market
00:14:19.250 || 00:14:19.260 || risk but it's based on some of these Key
00:14:21.290 || 00:14:21.300 || Driving factors these key indicators
00:14:24.170 || 00:14:24.180 || that you've been describing uh so people
00:14:25.550 || 00:14:25.560 || can watch that and see a single
00:14:27.290 || 00:14:27.300 || indicator that helps them get a gauge
00:14:29.750 || 00:14:29.760 || the risk people are concerned though
00:14:33.230 || 00:14:33.240 || that that when you get to this risky
00:14:36.350 || 00:14:36.360 || system uh that we're at and there's
00:14:38.389 || 00:14:38.399 || these interventions that have to keep
00:14:41.210 || 00:14:41.220 || happening that the that the potential
00:14:43.129 || 00:14:43.139 || lock up or the potential failure of the
00:14:46.189 || 00:14:46.199 || system could happen without warning over
00:14:49.009 || 00:14:49.019 || the weekend or whatever so um in fact
00:14:50.629 || 00:14:50.639 || we've already seen some you know it's
00:14:52.730 || 00:14:52.740 || like before a volcano blows off you see
00:14:54.949 || 00:14:54.959 || some some early Tremors or you see some
00:14:57.710 || 00:14:57.720 || leaking of of magma or whatever in this
00:15:00.710 || 00:15:00.720 || case we've seen the uh pivot by the uh
00:15:04.129 || 00:15:04.139 || we've had the British Bank have to have
00:15:06.290 || 00:15:06.300 || to back away from their quantitative
00:15:08.269 || 00:15:08.279 || measures and change their their plans
00:15:11.569 || 00:15:11.579 || we've had the so-called bankruptcy of
00:15:14.030 || 00:15:14.040 || the Royal Bank of Australia that had to
00:15:16.370 || 00:15:16.380 || get bailed out or basically refund
00:15:19.430 || 00:15:19.440 || recapitalized we've had the bank of
00:15:21.410 || 00:15:21.420 || Japan Retreat from the Line in the Sand
00:15:23.329 || 00:15:23.339 || that they were trying to defend the the
00:15:25.610 || 00:15:25.620 || so can you talk about these kind of
00:15:29.269 || 00:15:29.279 || these these signposts along the way to
00:15:31.490 || 00:15:31.500 || this to this moment that we were
00:15:33.470 || 00:15:33.480 || expecting but we don't know when it's
00:15:35.150 || 00:15:35.160 || going to happen
00:15:41.990 || 00:15:42.000 || I okay these cracks are going to have to
00:15:43.850 || 00:15:43.860 || be filled one way or the other least to
00:15:45.889 || 00:15:45.899 || keep this going until this whole thing
00:15:48.230 || 00:15:48.240 || eventually does end and this whole thing
00:15:49.550 || 00:15:49.560 || eventually is going to end here and
00:15:51.230 || 00:15:51.240 || again I'm going to push this point home
00:15:54.889 || 00:15:54.899 || everyone is focused on the stock market
00:15:57.290 || 00:15:57.300 || what's the stock market doing what's the
00:15:58.490 || 00:15:58.500 || stock market it's a distraction
00:16:00.710 || 00:16:00.720 || mechanism because the stock market is a
00:16:02.930 || 00:16:02.940 || derivative of what's happening in the
00:16:06.110 || 00:16:06.120 || global debt markets all of the world's
00:16:09.170 || 00:16:09.180 || Global Equity markets are 100 dependent
00:16:10.610 || 00:16:10.620 || on what's happening in the debt market
00:16:12.530 || 00:16:12.540 || so when you've got the mainstream
00:16:14.629 || 00:16:14.639 || meeting why do people think for example
00:16:17.990 || 00:16:18.000 || you turn on CNBC Bloomberg Fox they have
00:16:19.670 || 00:16:19.680 || you focused on the Dow Jones Industrial
00:16:21.170 || 00:16:21.180 || Average it's always about the Dow it's
00:16:22.970 || 00:16:22.980 || always about the Dow 30 companies they
00:16:24.710 || 00:16:24.720 || do not want people to look at the driver
00:16:26.509 || 00:16:26.519 || of the markets the driver of the market
00:16:29.930 || 00:16:29.940 || is the debt Market everything prices off
00:16:32.569 || 00:16:32.579 || or gained or achieves value from what's
00:16:35.150 || 00:16:35.160 || happening over there so if we people who
00:16:37.129 || 00:16:37.139 || know what they're looking at are focused
00:16:39.949 || 00:16:39.959 || on the debt Market we have a very good
00:16:41.749 || 00:16:41.759 || idea of where the stock market is going
00:16:42.829 || 00:16:42.839 || to everyone's worried about the stock
00:16:44.810 || 00:16:44.820 || market crash stock market question but
00:16:46.730 || 00:16:46.740 || it goes way way way beyond the stock
00:16:48.590 || 00:16:48.600 || market Chris because again a meltdown
00:16:50.749 || 00:16:50.759 || here in the dead Market is inevitable a
00:16:52.550 || 00:16:52.560 || spiking of rates is is going to happen
00:16:54.710 || 00:16:54.720 || in an unprecedented scale here it's like
00:16:56.569 || 00:16:56.579 || a rubber band being pulled back it's
00:16:58.430 || 00:16:58.440 || going to eventually go off here which is
00:17:00.050 || 00:17:00.060 || going to destroy the world Equity
00:17:02.389 || 00:17:02.399 || markets and then Cashes in my view is
00:17:04.789 || 00:17:04.799 || just going to move for as it always does
00:17:07.850 || 00:17:07.860 || from one set of assets into another and
00:17:08.929 || 00:17:08.939 || that is going to be in my view
00:17:10.189 || 00:17:10.199 || Commodities I've been telling people to
00:17:12.530 || 00:17:12.540 || watch Commodities in fact I put out a
00:17:15.069 || 00:17:15.079 || list of exchange traded funds
00:17:17.449 || 00:17:17.459 || commodity exchange Trader funds in my
00:17:19.370 || 00:17:19.380 || free newsletter which you can also
00:17:21.650 || 00:17:21.660 || subscribe to is 100 free on from my
00:17:24.409 || 00:17:24.419 || website traderschoice.net so again
00:17:27.110 || 00:17:27.120 || understanding the driver here realizing
00:17:29.150 || 00:17:29.160 || that we need to focus on the global bond
00:17:30.289 || 00:17:30.299 || market
00:17:32.630 || 00:17:32.640 || we we have the biggest tell in the world
00:17:34.130 || 00:17:34.140 || as to when this is whole thing is
00:17:36.409 || 00:17:36.419 || actually going to end and when we start
00:17:38.270 || 00:17:38.280 || to see and we've seen this already
00:17:40.070 || 00:17:40.080 || several times on controlled spikes in
00:17:42.110 || 00:17:42.120 || the 10-year yield uncontrolled spiking
00:17:43.370 || 00:17:43.380 || in the global debt market and then
00:17:44.870 || 00:17:44.880 || central banks all of a sudden all of a
00:17:46.549 || 00:17:46.559 || sudden some miracle happens like it just
00:17:49.490 || 00:17:49.500 || happened today where oh bunions are
00:17:51.650 || 00:17:51.660 || dropping well who's buying do you know
00:17:53.570 || 00:17:53.580 || what it would take does anybody have an
00:17:55.669 || 00:17:55.679 || idea of the amount of cash you would
00:17:58.310 || 00:17:58.320 || take in influx of cash into the global
00:18:00.529 || 00:18:00.539 || debt Market to cause even the fraction
00:18:01.909 || 00:18:01.919 || of a fraction of a fraction of a
00:18:04.190 || 00:18:04.200 || fraction of a dropping yield so this is
00:18:06.710 || 00:18:06.720 || huge amounts of cash that's being
00:18:10.070 || 00:18:10.080 || flooded now to buy this debt pushing
00:18:12.529 || 00:18:12.539 || yields lower and that's who it is this
00:18:14.690 || 00:18:14.700 || is sensual Banks they're not going to
00:18:16.730 || 00:18:16.740 || tell anyone but who else is doing it I
00:18:18.770 || 00:18:18.780 || mean it's common sense
00:18:21.230 || 00:18:21.240 || you mentioned uh earlier about the
00:18:22.909 || 00:18:22.919 || distraction the look here don't look
00:18:25.310 || 00:18:25.320 || there focus on the Dow don't focus on on
00:18:28.250 || 00:18:28.260 || the real drivers you also mentioned
00:18:32.270 || 00:18:32.280 || that you you for to see a shift of funds
00:18:35.270 || 00:18:35.280 || out of uh both bonds and stocks and into
00:18:36.470 || 00:18:36.480 || commodities
00:18:39.650 || 00:18:39.660 || that Echoes what's been discussed quite
00:18:41.990 || 00:18:42.000 || a bit recently about a split uh
00:18:43.970 || 00:18:43.980 || geopolitically of the East and the west
00:18:47.210 || 00:18:47.220 || where the Western Financial World pretty
00:18:49.190 || 00:18:49.200 || much Europe and the United States and
00:18:51.830 || 00:18:51.840 || North America and Japan are all in this
00:18:54.049 || 00:18:54.059 || what you called earlier in this in today
00:18:57.590 || 00:18:57.600 || uh this all all derivative all based on
00:19:00.890 || 00:19:00.900 || nothing you know uh Financial system so
00:19:03.710 || 00:19:03.720 || this this financialization uh and
00:19:05.090 || 00:19:05.100 || derivatives upon derivatives upon
00:19:07.190 || 00:19:07.200 || derivatives in the west whereas in the
00:19:09.169 || 00:19:09.179 || East characterized by the brics plus
00:19:14.090 || 00:19:14.100 || Nations uh based on Commodities so even
00:19:15.710 || 00:19:15.720 || talking about that as the basis for
00:19:17.090 || 00:19:17.100 || their potential settlement currencies
00:19:19.850 || 00:19:19.860 || that sort of thing can you draw that
00:19:21.770 || 00:19:21.780 || that implications to us what does that
00:19:23.870 || 00:19:23.880 || mean to you when you talk about central
00:19:25.370 || 00:19:25.380 || banks because you've been using you
00:19:26.870 || 00:19:26.880 || haven't been distinguishing between East
00:19:28.310 || 00:19:28.320 || versus West when you've been saying that
00:19:30.230 || 00:19:30.240 || when central banks are looking to try to
00:19:31.850 || 00:19:31.860 || be the buyers and lenders of Last Resort
00:19:34.690 || 00:19:34.700 || what does that mean in a world where
00:19:37.370 || 00:19:37.380 || their mechanism of doing that these Fiat
00:19:39.409 || 00:19:39.419 || currencies are doomed to collapse
00:19:42.890 || 00:19:42.900 || whereas in the in the East they're
00:19:45.590 || 00:19:45.600 || basing their financial they're pinning
00:19:47.990 || 00:19:48.000 || their financial hopes to Commodities to
00:19:49.669 || 00:19:49.679 || solid things how does that how does that
00:19:50.990 || 00:19:51.000 || play out in your view
00:19:52.430 || 00:19:52.440 || well that makes perfect sense because
00:19:53.690 || 00:19:53.700 || that's where this that's what small
00:19:55.730 || 00:19:55.740 || people should be doing here putting
00:19:57.710 || 00:19:57.720 || their cash to work in real things
00:19:59.870 || 00:19:59.880 || understand look understanding where
00:20:00.830 || 00:20:00.840 || we're going
00:20:02.570 || 00:20:02.580 || um there's no doubt in my mind that that
00:20:05.390 || 00:20:05.400 || scenario I've outlined with the debt
00:20:07.370 || 00:20:07.380 || Market implosion killing the stock
00:20:10.490 || 00:20:10.500 || market and cash just moving uh that into
00:20:12.770 || 00:20:12.780 || heart real real things like Commodities
00:20:14.570 || 00:20:14.580 || I've been telling people that since for
00:20:16.909 || 00:20:16.919 || 10 years at least and um and that's
00:20:18.289 || 00:20:18.299 || that's the way it's gonna it's gonna
00:20:20.570 || 00:20:20.580 || play out here I also said in a recent
00:20:22.010 || 00:20:22.020 || video in fact I think it was the last
00:20:25.390 || 00:20:25.400 || one I did 2022 was we're going to see
00:20:29.150 || 00:20:29.160 || much more dramatic currency devaluation
00:20:31.610 || 00:20:31.620 || as central banks continue to inflate
00:20:33.409 || 00:20:33.419 || they're not going to stop and what
00:20:35.270 || 00:20:35.280 || people are going to say why does central
00:20:37.490 || 00:20:37.500 || banks want to continue to inflict well
00:20:39.350 || 00:20:39.360 || the answer is very very simple the the
00:20:42.830 || 00:20:42.840 || more debt essential banking issue in the
00:20:44.510 || 00:20:44.520 || form of currency these are units of debt
00:20:46.490 || 00:20:46.500 || the stronger they become people have no
00:20:47.870 || 00:20:47.880 || idea that's how it actually works and
00:20:49.909 || 00:20:49.919 || this is why central banks have have
00:20:52.010 || 00:20:52.020 || forced every quote on developed Nation
00:20:55.190 || 00:20:55.200 || to become a slave to them and they're
00:20:56.810 || 00:20:56.820 || more than happy to lend now absolutely
00:20:59.029 || 00:20:59.039 || I'm not I'm not shocked at all to hear
00:21:02.990 || 00:21:03.000 || about how the East wants to structure I
00:21:04.669 || 00:21:04.679 || guess the Investments and looking down
00:21:06.529 || 00:21:06.539 || the line because you see they have a
00:21:09.710 || 00:21:09.720 || long-term game here uh we we you know
00:21:11.870 || 00:21:11.880 || everyone's playing the short game and
00:21:14.029 || 00:21:14.039 || it's it's coming apart it's coming apart
00:21:16.730 || 00:21:16.740 || it's coming apart very very quickly and
00:21:19.730 || 00:21:19.740 || I think in 2023 this is going to start
00:21:21.710 || 00:21:21.720 || to accelerate here I'm not saying it's
00:21:23.510 || 00:21:23.520 || going to end here I have no idea where
00:21:25.430 || 00:21:25.440 || it's when it's going to end I focus on
00:21:27.590 || 00:21:27.600 || the debt Market every single day the
00:21:29.870 || 00:21:29.880 || first thing I look at is what is the
00:21:32.510 || 00:21:32.520 || debt market doing what are bonds telling
00:21:35.450 || 00:21:35.460 || me what is the debt Market telling me
00:21:38.570 || 00:21:38.580 || things are going right now again as I
00:21:40.010 || 00:21:40.020 || said we have this phenomenon of the
00:21:42.529 || 00:21:42.539 || rising uh bondios as they were selling
00:21:44.289 || 00:21:44.299 || off now there's a rally today a
00:21:47.390 || 00:21:47.400 || miraculous rally why well a central
00:21:48.770 || 00:21:48.780 || based trying to stabilize the system
00:21:50.090 || 00:21:50.100 || we're trying to give the illusion of
00:21:52.250 || 00:21:52.260 || stability with without that mechanism is
00:21:54.830 || 00:21:54.840 || over this whole thing will end in a nano
00:21:56.870 || 00:21:56.880 || second and all this is going to get very
00:21:58.669 || 00:21:58.679 || real one at one point and the more that
00:22:00.409 || 00:22:00.419 || they continue to fuel the system this
00:22:02.510 || 00:22:02.520 || way the worse it's going to be and they
00:22:04.010 || 00:22:04.020 || know that too and they're counting on it
00:22:06.770 || 00:22:06.780 || they need the system to become extremely
00:22:09.529 || 00:22:09.539 || toxic so when the bottom eventually
00:22:12.710 || 00:22:12.720 || falls out this happens overnight very
00:22:15.350 || 00:22:15.360 || very very quickly not a slow burn a
00:22:18.950 || 00:22:18.960 || rapid shifting of where asset prices are
00:22:20.570 || 00:22:20.580 || going to go based off of action here in
00:22:22.130 || 00:22:22.140 || the debt Market it's just so obvious to
00:22:23.270 || 00:22:23.280 || me
00:22:25.070 || 00:22:25.080 || can you talk to us for a moment about
00:22:28.310 || 00:22:28.320 || that very specific question about United
00:22:31.669 || 00:22:31.679 || States uh bank account
00:22:34.669 || 00:22:34.679 || risk versus safety in the face of the
00:22:36.770 || 00:22:36.780 || recent statements by the FDIC about
00:22:38.870 || 00:22:38.880 || let's not inform the public let's just
00:22:40.430 || 00:22:40.440 || inform the meet the most major money
00:22:43.610 || 00:22:43.620 || managers about about our ability to
00:22:46.010 || 00:22:46.020 || cover uh banking shortages that sort of
00:22:48.110 || 00:22:48.120 || thing well insurance through the FDIC
00:22:50.090 || 00:22:50.100 || first of all it's not guaranteed to
00:22:51.350 || 00:22:51.360 || anybody they're going to say that that
00:22:53.149 || 00:22:53.159 || is going to be that would be completely
00:22:55.430 || 00:22:55.440 || insolvent as well so if people are
00:23:00.649 || 00:23:00.659 || counting on uh the FDIC to make them a
00:23:02.990 || 00:23:03.000 || whole uh well I I think they have
00:23:05.270 || 00:23:05.280 || something else coming here oh absolutely
00:23:06.830 || 00:23:06.840 || the whole system you know based on
00:23:09.350 || 00:23:09.360 || fractional Reserve based on a multiplier
00:23:11.210 || 00:23:11.220 || as a matter of fact
00:23:13.370 || 00:23:13.380 || um you know it's it's it's just the
00:23:15.350 || 00:23:15.360 || whole system is just so fake and no
00:23:16.850 || 00:23:16.860 || people are going to get crushed and I
00:23:19.310 || 00:23:19.320 || think that's the other worry is what in
00:23:21.470 || 00:23:21.480 || in the event of and when it does occur
00:23:24.549 || 00:23:24.559 || of a total meltdown in the debt Market
00:23:28.070 || 00:23:28.080 || are is anybody's cash that they don't
00:23:30.649 || 00:23:30.659 || that's in these institutions it's safe
00:23:32.870 || 00:23:32.880 || at all I don't think so I don't once it
00:23:34.490 || 00:23:34.500 || leaves people don't understand this or
00:23:37.070 || 00:23:37.080 || at school when when that cash leaves
00:23:40.789 || 00:23:40.799 || your hand and ends up in a financial
00:23:43.610 || 00:23:43.620 || institution it's theirs it actually
00:23:47.149 || 00:23:47.159 || comes theirs it's not yours anymore and
00:23:49.010 || 00:23:49.020 || then they lend it out they on a
00:23:51.289 || 00:23:51.299 || multiplier how it all works so I don't
00:23:53.450 || 00:23:53.460 || think people understand it it's not the
00:23:55.850 || 00:23:55.860 || system they're meant to believe exists
00:23:58.430 || 00:23:58.440 || uh when you put your cash in one of
00:24:00.649 || 00:24:00.659 || these institutions you lose a lot of
00:24:03.649 || 00:24:03.659 || your rights to it uh and that would
00:24:06.169 || 00:24:06.179 || include uh if in a full-on collapse of
00:24:08.510 || 00:24:08.520 || the system just you just well frankly
00:24:09.830 || 00:24:09.840 || screwed
00:24:11.330 || 00:24:11.340 || um you know people used to what they
00:24:12.710 || 00:24:12.720 || used to do in the old days use the whole
00:24:14.510 || 00:24:14.520 || cash under the mattress you know then it
00:24:16.190 || 00:24:16.200 || was still at least in your own hands but
00:24:18.409 || 00:24:18.419 || when it gets transferred to another
00:24:20.930 || 00:24:20.940 || party it's really not yours anymore and
00:24:22.310 || 00:24:22.320 || they can do what they want if that means
00:24:24.110 || 00:24:24.120 || a bail in well they're gonna do that
00:24:26.390 || 00:24:26.400 || though the people are gonna be forced as
00:24:29.450 || 00:24:29.460 || they always are to Bear the brunt of
00:24:32.330 || 00:24:32.340 || what's coming down the pike until that
00:24:34.970 || 00:24:34.980 || time you know we sit back we we don't
00:24:36.770 || 00:24:36.780 || change our strategy everyone on who
00:24:38.390 || 00:24:38.400 || follows my work and I'm sure yours is
00:24:40.250 || 00:24:40.260 || betting against the debt becoming your
00:24:42.470 || 00:24:42.480 || own Central Bank holding hard assets you
00:24:44.590 || 00:24:44.600 || know for that eventual
00:24:48.409 || 00:24:48.419 || reset to this uh to this the in the
00:24:50.450 || 00:24:50.460 || financial system and then what they're
00:24:51.770 || 00:24:51.780 || going to do again we're going to
00:24:53.270 || 00:24:53.280 || obviously
00:24:55.549 || 00:24:55.559 || um the current system is going to
00:24:57.710 || 00:24:57.720 || implode and a new system is going to be
00:25:00.470 || 00:25:00.480 || introduced obviously uh
00:25:02.810 || 00:25:02.820 || people are gonna they need an outcry
00:25:05.330 || 00:25:05.340 || very very big so they need people to be
00:25:08.270 || 00:25:08.280 || come and have no alternative in other
00:25:09.710 || 00:25:09.720 || words let's see going back to what we
00:25:11.930 || 00:25:11.940 || were talking about with regard to cash
00:25:13.549 || 00:25:13.559 || in these accounts okay don't worry we're
00:25:15.470 || 00:25:15.480 || going to give you this instead they're
00:25:17.029 || 00:25:17.039 || going to offer every solution you can
00:25:19.430 || 00:25:19.440 || think about and it's already in the
00:25:21.710 || 00:25:21.720 || works here absolutely we're going to a
00:25:23.870 || 00:25:23.880 || completely digital cashless system
00:25:26.330 || 00:25:26.340 || there's no doubt about that and we're
00:25:27.649 || 00:25:27.659 || going to see and I think we're going to
00:25:30.049 || 00:25:30.059 || see a lot of other things occur uh more
00:25:32.930 || 00:25:32.940 || war expansion of War more or more cash
00:25:35.510 || 00:25:35.520 || to fund Wars as well I mean all of this
00:25:36.950 || 00:25:36.960 || is all plays together and people that
00:25:39.230 || 00:25:39.240 || you know fighting Wars that we never
00:25:42.289 || 00:25:42.299 || even voted on funding to the tunes of
00:25:44.210 || 00:25:44.220 || hundreds of billions and I said right at
00:25:45.049 || 00:25:45.059 || the beginning is going to be in the
00:25:46.789 || 00:25:46.799 || trillions which it will be and this
00:25:48.710 || 00:25:48.720 || mechanism is going to be utilized by
00:25:52.010 || 00:25:52.020 || central banks to continue to inflate uh
00:25:53.750 || 00:25:53.760 || everything that you and I have been
00:25:55.610 || 00:25:55.620 || talking about for a long time is coming
00:25:57.769 || 00:25:57.779 || true and if people were to look at some
00:25:59.330 || 00:25:59.340 || of our work from a while back they would
00:26:01.010 || 00:26:01.020 || go wow how did they how do they pull
00:26:02.330 || 00:26:02.340 || that out of the Hat because it's just so
00:26:04.669 || 00:26:04.679 || easy I think to just look at the Players
00:26:06.950 || 00:26:06.960 || what's involved what they're trying to
00:26:10.190 || 00:26:10.200 || achieve and it just doesn't seem so
00:26:11.570 || 00:26:11.580 || far-fetched to me to understand where
00:26:14.029 || 00:26:14.039 || the most likely outcomes are going to be
00:26:15.710 || 00:26:15.720 || just over the weekend again we heard an
00:26:18.590 || 00:26:18.600 || announcement about China has started
00:26:21.590 || 00:26:21.600 || allowing international flights uh to go
00:26:22.669 || 00:26:22.679 || even though they're not allowing
00:26:24.169 || 00:26:24.179 || domestic travel within their country
00:26:26.529 || 00:26:26.539 || with lockdowns and a whole bunch of uh
00:26:29.149 || 00:26:29.159 || illnesses and deaths supposedly uh due
00:26:32.090 || 00:26:32.100 || to a new variant of uh of an illness it
00:26:34.070 || 00:26:34.080 || seems like we're replaying up what
00:26:36.169 || 00:26:36.179 || happened uh two and a half years ago
00:26:40.310 || 00:26:40.320 || doesn't it doesn't it yes it does so
00:26:41.570 || 00:26:41.580 || these the can you talk to us for a
00:26:42.830 || 00:26:42.840 || moment about you you talked about look
00:26:43.909 || 00:26:43.919 || here don't look there and you talk about
00:26:45.409 || 00:26:45.419 || look at the Dow what about these
00:26:47.029 || 00:26:47.039 || never-ending series of crises because
00:26:48.289 || 00:26:48.299 || that's what you were just getting to and
00:26:50.269 || 00:26:50.279 || I was hoping you would uh about whether
00:26:52.370 || 00:26:52.380 || whether it's War whether it's pestilence
00:26:54.409 || 00:26:54.419 || whether it's whatever what that's what
00:26:56.269 || 00:26:56.279 || we have it's a crisis to crisis
00:26:58.549 || 00:26:58.559 || mechanism and that is it's it's being
00:27:00.649 || 00:27:00.659 || utilized it's been weaponized the entire
00:27:02.810 || 00:27:02.820 || system every bit of it is now completely
00:27:05.450 || 00:27:05.460 || weaponized and uh it's about creating
00:27:08.090 || 00:27:08.100 || fear make people afraid of one thing you
00:27:10.010 || 00:27:10.020 || can control their minds and now it's
00:27:12.110 || 00:27:12.120 || just a miracle that this new variant
00:27:14.690 || 00:27:14.700 || here 41 of new cases here double every
00:27:16.730 || 00:27:16.740 || week or suppose is what they say in this
00:27:21.890 || 00:27:21.900 || x b b 0.15 I think that's what it is uh
00:27:23.990 || 00:27:24.000 || it's now taken over and then you know of
00:27:25.789 || 00:27:25.799 || course there's all these oh we need a
00:27:28.490 || 00:27:28.500 || new this and we need new pills a more
00:27:30.230 || 00:27:30.240 || cash to be thrown at that so yeah it's
00:27:31.970 || 00:27:31.980 || another crisis that's how we function
00:27:34.310 || 00:27:34.320 || from crisis to crisis to crisis more
00:27:35.750 || 00:27:35.760 || cash thrown at this that and the other
00:27:37.730 || 00:27:37.740 || thing it's all part of the same
00:27:39.890 || 00:27:39.900 || mechanism people have no idea they don't
00:27:41.810 || 00:27:41.820 || understand that's what's what's going on
00:27:43.970 || 00:27:43.980 || they don't understand that that's how it
00:27:46.730 || 00:27:46.740 || has to work imagine if we had just one
00:27:49.310 || 00:27:49.320 || one of our politicians come out and
00:27:51.830 || 00:27:51.840 || explain people Hey listen uh we have a
00:27:53.390 || 00:27:53.400 || big secret to tell you this is how the
00:27:54.649 || 00:27:54.659 || system works and what that person would
00:27:55.909 || 00:27:55.919 || have that have a bullet in their head
00:27:58.909 || 00:27:58.919 || that's what happened it's the truth yeah
00:28:00.830 || 00:28:00.840 || Greg I promise people at the beginning
00:28:02.210 || 00:28:02.220 || of our interview that we'd let them know

00:30:29.810 || 00:30:29.820 || we all got together we realized what
00:30:31.070 || 00:30:31.080 || they're trying to do to us divide
00:30:32.510 || 00:30:32.520 || conquer make us hate each other for
00:30:33.889 || 00:30:33.899 || whatever reason they could come out with
00:30:36.289 || 00:30:36.299 || up with we'd all be a lot better off but
00:30:37.490 || 00:30:37.500 || unfortunately there's so many people
00:30:38.990 || 00:30:39.000 || that are brainwashed and stuck into
00:30:41.269 || 00:30:41.279 || whatever trap that they've been that has
00:30:42.889 || 00:30:42.899 || been set for them but if we just do
