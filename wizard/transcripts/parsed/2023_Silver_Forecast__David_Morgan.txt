00:00:02.149 || 00:00:02.159 || hey everyone this is Elijah K Johnson
00:00:04.850 || 00:00:04.860 || with liberty and finance and today we
00:00:06.889 || 00:00:06.899 || have a special live report this is live
00:00:09.230 || 00:00:09.240 || so you can submit questions for David
00:00:11.930 || 00:00:11.940 || Morgan here uh in the live chat we have
00:00:14.810 || 00:00:14.820 || David Morgan from uh so the silver Guru
00:00:16.670 || 00:00:16.680 || from the Morgan report David thank you
00:00:18.290 || 00:00:18.300 || so much for joining us today
00:00:20.750 || 00:00:20.760 || my pleasure Elijah thanks for having me
00:00:22.370 || 00:00:22.380 || well it's great to have you and I did
00:00:25.370 || 00:00:25.380 || want to kind of discuss if you know what
00:00:27.050 || 00:00:27.060 || this year has been for precious metals
00:00:28.429 || 00:00:28.439 || it seems like we've had quite a wild
00:00:31.009 || 00:00:31.019 || ride I mean if you just look like a
00:00:32.990 || 00:00:33.000 || month two or two months ago you know we
00:00:35.750 || 00:00:35.760 || were at 18 silver we even went below 18
00:00:37.729 || 00:00:37.739 || for a little while here but now we're at
00:00:41.090 || 00:00:41.100 || 23 plus got into the 24s a couple days
00:00:41.990 || 00:00:42.000 || ago
00:00:44.030 || 00:00:44.040 || um what do you make of this Wild Ride
00:00:46.069 || 00:00:46.079 || we've seen this year in this dramatic
00:00:47.389 || 00:00:47.399 || increase we've seen the last couple
00:00:48.770 || 00:00:48.780 || months
00:00:51.529 || 00:00:51.539 || well from the year-over-year perspective
00:00:54.170 || 00:00:54.180 || we did basically a round trip we went
00:00:57.709 || 00:00:57.719 || from around 22 in January or this year
00:01:00.830 || 00:01:00.840 || up to 26 double top 26 a couple times
00:01:03.229 || 00:01:03.239 || and then came all the way back up to 22
00:01:04.609 || 00:01:04.619 || and it's only been in the last few
00:01:06.590 || 00:01:06.600 || trading sessions where we got to 24 as
00:01:10.310 || 00:01:10.320 || you mentioned uh so there's that part I
00:01:12.770 || 00:01:12.780 || think from another perspective comparing
00:01:15.710 || 00:01:15.720 || other asset classes I just did my weekly
00:01:17.090 || 00:01:17.100 || podcast
00:01:20.390 || 00:01:20.400 || you know crypto or Bitcoins down 70
00:01:24.230 || 00:01:24.240 || percent and silver is you know not off
00:01:27.109 || 00:01:27.119 || it's it's flat to slightly up
00:01:29.990 || 00:01:30.000 || so relative to the crypto space you know
00:01:32.450 || 00:01:32.460 || Silver's held its own Gold's in the same
00:01:35.330 || 00:01:35.340 || situation I think a couple things Elijah
00:01:38.330 || 00:01:38.340 || one we used to always get a very good
00:01:41.210 || 00:01:41.220 || seasonal year-end rally
00:01:43.969 || 00:01:43.979 || um from the time I started avidly in the
00:01:46.450 || 00:01:46.460 || silver market in my 20s
00:01:50.630 || 00:01:50.640 || almost every year from now late November
00:01:53.749 || 00:01:53.759 || into and usually through January you
00:01:56.149 || 00:01:56.159 || would see a rally and then the last
00:01:58.969 || 00:01:58.979 || decade or so several years let's say
00:02:00.530 || 00:02:00.540 || five
00:02:03.889 || 00:02:03.899 || on four so we're consecutive the lowest
00:02:05.990 || 00:02:06.000 || print for the year was the last trading
00:02:09.770 || 00:02:09.780 || day and that's very different and you
00:02:11.089 || 00:02:11.099 || know this reality has happened so now
00:02:12.770 || 00:02:12.780 || we're back to the rally mode
00:02:15.170 || 00:02:15.180 || uh platinum and Palladium usually get a
00:02:17.809 || 00:02:17.819 || rally in January that's pretty seasonal
00:02:19.910 || 00:02:19.920 || that's the highest probability of the
00:02:21.830 || 00:02:21.840 || seasonalities that I know of
00:02:23.390 || 00:02:23.400 || and so I think there's a couple things
00:02:24.890 || 00:02:24.900 || going on you know it's the physical
00:02:27.050 || 00:02:27.060 || demand it's been strong all year it's
00:02:29.150 || 00:02:29.160 || starting to fall off now the premiums
00:02:31.790 || 00:02:31.800 || are coming down but we've had a really
00:02:34.729 || 00:02:34.739 || strong uh silver market as far as a
00:02:38.510 || 00:02:38.520 || retail Market is concerned and
00:02:41.809 || 00:02:41.819 || the gold market is doing
00:02:44.210 || 00:02:44.220 || okay maybe even better than silver from
00:02:47.030 || 00:02:47.040 || uh you know that doesn't dip as much and
00:02:50.330 || 00:02:50.340 || it's less volatile but um central banks
00:02:53.030 || 00:02:53.040 || have been net buyers of gold and this
00:02:55.309 || 00:02:55.319 || continues to happen and it's making you
00:02:58.130 || 00:02:58.140 || know somewhat the mainstream news where
00:03:00.170 || 00:03:00.180 || the central banks have added to their
00:03:01.790 || 00:03:01.800 || positions and have the largest Holdings
00:03:05.089 || 00:03:05.099 || they've had since 1975. and I my comment
00:03:07.309 || 00:03:07.319 || on that is that gold is the money Last
00:03:08.869 || 00:03:08.879 || Resorts and gold is the money The
00:03:11.630 || 00:03:11.640 || Establishment even though
00:03:14.750 || 00:03:14.760 || it's not recognized on your mainstream
00:03:17.210 || 00:03:17.220 || Financial channels but the banks all
00:03:19.130 || 00:03:19.140 || have it they have it for a reason if
00:03:21.710 || 00:03:21.720 || they need it they can revalue it and
00:03:24.229 || 00:03:24.239 || issue you know gold back currency they
00:03:27.110 || 00:03:27.120 || had to do it I don't think that's in the
00:03:29.030 || 00:03:29.040 || cards exactly some do think that the
00:03:30.710 || 00:03:30.720 || next system will be going back it could
00:03:33.290 || 00:03:33.300 || be I certainly don't know but I do know
00:03:35.089 || 00:03:35.099 || what their philosophy is and that is to
00:03:37.130 || 00:03:37.140 || maintain control control the money
00:03:38.630 || 00:03:38.640 || system and the best way you can control
00:03:41.270 || 00:03:41.280 || the money system if it has perceived
00:03:43.369 || 00:03:43.379 || value but no real value that way you can
00:03:45.170 || 00:03:45.180 || inflate it or make it you know whatever
00:03:48.170 || 00:03:48.180 || amount you want Gold's a policeman on
00:03:50.390 || 00:03:50.400 || the currency if you have a true gold
00:03:52.490 || 00:03:52.500 || backing then the gold will prevent you
00:03:54.170 || 00:03:54.180 || from inflating the currency Supply
00:03:55.430 || 00:03:55.440 || because it's got to have a
00:03:56.869 || 00:03:56.879 || correspondence to a certain amount of
00:03:59.030 || 00:03:59.040 || gold and the gold Supply only grows at
00:04:00.890 || 00:04:00.900 || one and a half percent a year so that
00:04:02.210 || 00:04:02.220 || means you could have a one and a half
00:04:04.490 || 00:04:04.500 || percent growth in the monetary Supply
00:04:06.470 || 00:04:06.480 || but that doesn't necessarily mean your
00:04:07.729 || 00:04:07.739 || GDP would only grow one and a half
00:04:10.250 || 00:04:10.260 || percent you'd have a five percent GDP
00:04:12.229 || 00:04:12.239 || growth with one and a half percent
00:04:16.250 || 00:04:16.260 || growth in money because as humans of you
00:04:18.409 || 00:04:18.419 || know as the human experiences you get
00:04:21.110 || 00:04:21.120 || better and better productivity as time
00:04:22.969 || 00:04:22.979 || goes on I mean a quick example for
00:04:25.430 || 00:04:25.440 || everybody is like an iPhone 2 versus an
00:04:27.830 || 00:04:27.840 || iPhone 12 or 13 14 whatever they are now
00:04:29.390 || 00:04:29.400 || you know I mean there weren't even
00:04:31.550 || 00:04:31.560 || smartphones up until what a decade ago
00:04:34.670 || 00:04:34.680 || or so so my point being is that um you
00:04:37.550 || 00:04:37.560 || can continue to improve economically at
00:04:40.550 || 00:04:40.560 || a different rate than the money supply
00:04:42.590 || 00:04:42.600 || problem now of course has been we
00:04:44.330 || 00:04:44.340 || increase the money supply and get a
00:04:46.610 || 00:04:46.620 || negative return we have to put out five
00:04:49.310 || 00:04:49.320 || or six dollars of funding money to get
00:04:51.650 || 00:04:51.660 || one dollar growth you go broke doing
00:04:53.330 || 00:04:53.340 || that
00:04:55.850 || 00:04:55.860 || no when it comes to the demand we've
00:04:57.409 || 00:04:57.419 || been seeing for the medals we've been
00:04:59.090 || 00:04:59.100 || you know both reporting on this and
00:05:01.370 || 00:05:01.380 || you're mentioning uh the central banks
00:05:03.230 || 00:05:03.240 || acquiring precious metals we're also
00:05:06.530 || 00:05:06.540 || seeing the uh exchanges being drained if
00:05:08.270 || 00:05:08.280 || we look at the registered category on
00:05:09.710 || 00:05:09.720 || the comex I believe we were just looking
00:05:12.710 || 00:05:12.720 || at 33 million ounces so this is even
00:05:15.110 || 00:05:15.120 || lower than the last time we talked about
00:05:17.810 || 00:05:17.820 || this your perspective on uh that and
00:05:19.909 || 00:05:19.919 || where do you think that's heading
00:05:22.189 || 00:05:22.199 || it's hard to say I mean I've you know
00:05:23.990 || 00:05:24.000 || look at this Market probably as long as
00:05:26.749 || 00:05:26.759 || anybody other than maybe Ted Butler and
00:05:27.409 || 00:05:27.419 || um
00:05:29.450 || 00:05:29.460 || I've seen it down this low I've seen it
00:05:31.370 || 00:05:31.380 || lower than this a couple of times and in
00:05:33.409 || 00:05:33.419 || both instances I was kind of like oh man
00:05:35.170 || 00:05:35.180 || this is it you know there's no
00:05:37.969 || 00:05:37.979 || registered left this is gonna you know
00:05:39.830 || 00:05:39.840 || the comex is gonna die or you know
00:05:41.749 || 00:05:41.759 || whatever and
00:05:45.110 || 00:05:45.120 || um miraculously uh bunch of silver came
00:05:48.710 || 00:05:48.720 || in and and replenished the stockpile of
00:05:50.689 || 00:05:50.699 || the Dealer's inventory which is the
00:05:53.210 || 00:05:53.220 || registered category uh this time I'm not
00:05:54.770 || 00:05:54.780 || so sure I wasn't paying as much
00:05:57.050 || 00:05:57.060 || attention to lbma back in those days
00:05:59.150 || 00:05:59.160 || which I should have but I didn't this
00:06:01.550 || 00:06:01.560 || time it's both the lbma and the comex as
00:06:06.050 || 00:06:06.060 || you said and I'm not I'm not sure I mean
00:06:08.029 || 00:06:08.039 || a trend in motion continues till it
00:06:10.550 || 00:06:10.560 || actually stops so the trend is very
00:06:13.430 || 00:06:13.440 || clear that there's drains going on in
00:06:15.650 || 00:06:15.660 || the silver Supply and you're seeing
00:06:19.689 || 00:06:19.699 || metal come off of the SLV so someone's
00:06:23.210 || 00:06:23.220 || somebody's wants the physical silver for
00:06:25.129 || 00:06:25.139 || whatever reason and you know there's a
00:06:27.189 || 00:06:27.199 || huge Arbitrage when you take a silver
00:06:30.170 || 00:06:30.180 || brick and a thousand ounces and turn it
00:06:32.390 || 00:06:32.400 || into 10 ounce bars 100 ounce bars one
00:06:35.390 || 00:06:35.400 || ounce coins the retail markup on that
00:06:37.610 || 00:06:37.620 || silver product it's made out of silver
00:06:40.610 || 00:06:40.620 || is huge so you know there's a lot of
00:06:42.710 || 00:06:42.720 || incentive to put out more product that
00:06:44.990 || 00:06:45.000 || the retail investor wants and there's a
00:06:47.749 || 00:06:47.759 || ready market for it so that could be
00:06:50.590 || 00:06:50.600 || part of the equation the rest is
00:06:53.870 || 00:06:53.880 || industrial demand really hasn't subsided
00:06:55.430 || 00:06:55.440 || especially with what's going on the
00:06:57.650 || 00:06:57.660 || energy sphere with
00:07:01.670 || 00:07:01.680 || um Europe being you know in Dire Straits
00:07:03.469 || 00:07:03.479 || with the amount of energy that they need
00:07:05.090 || 00:07:05.100 || the amount they're actually able to
00:07:08.749 || 00:07:08.759 || produce so they're dependent on you know
00:07:12.110 || 00:07:12.120 || Russia and alternative means of heat
00:07:13.610 || 00:07:13.620 || like wood
00:07:15.529 || 00:07:15.539 || and that of course
00:07:17.210 || 00:07:17.220 || um goes into the alternative energy
00:07:19.249 || 00:07:19.259 || which is solar primarily in wind powers
00:07:20.809 || 00:07:20.819 || we all know and of course that means
00:07:23.450 || 00:07:23.460 || there's you know a non-ceasing demand
00:07:25.189 || 00:07:25.199 || for solar at the present time and that's
00:07:26.689 || 00:07:26.699 || probably going to increase
00:07:29.210 || 00:07:29.220 || so we have a lot of vectors that point
00:07:32.029 || 00:07:32.039 || to Silver for a variety of reasons and
00:07:34.670 || 00:07:34.680 || we do see the drainage continuing I do
00:07:36.650 || 00:07:36.660 || have to point out that
00:07:40.370 || 00:07:40.380 || many silver Advocates over years and
00:07:42.529 || 00:07:42.539 || years have said again and again that you
00:07:45.350 || 00:07:45.360 || know there's this much silver that's in
00:07:49.010 || 00:07:49.020 || the uh delivery month and there's just
00:07:50.510 || 00:07:50.520 || been a contracts for their delivery
00:07:53.390 || 00:07:53.400 || month and Presto change how it's going
00:07:55.070 || 00:07:55.080 || to happen this month and it never does
00:07:56.689 || 00:07:56.699 || and the reason it doesn't is because
00:07:58.189 || 00:07:58.199 || most of those contracts are
00:07:59.510 || 00:07:59.520 || professionals when they do what's called
00:08:02.029 || 00:08:02.039 || a rollover so they roll over from the
00:08:04.309 || 00:08:04.319 || delivery month of December into the next
00:08:07.010 || 00:08:07.020 || delivery month of just March and there's
00:08:08.930 || 00:08:08.940 || Advocates that you know have a pretty
00:08:11.770 || 00:08:11.780 || good reputation but they get it wrong
00:08:14.350 || 00:08:14.360 || and I'm not saying it couldn't happen
00:08:17.150 || 00:08:17.160 || and Theory could happen the other thing
00:08:18.950 || 00:08:18.960 || is they get excited about when you get
00:08:20.749 || 00:08:20.759 || past first notice day and you get into
00:08:22.490 || 00:08:22.500 || the final delivery day
00:08:24.050 || 00:08:24.060 || and I have from personal experience
00:08:26.029 || 00:08:26.039 || because I have taken metal off exchange
00:08:28.129 || 00:08:28.139 || not a lot of these people that
00:08:30.469 || 00:08:30.479 || comment on it haven't really done what
00:08:32.389 || 00:08:32.399 || I've done in the industry
00:08:34.610 || 00:08:34.620 || and I got kind of behind the eight ball
00:08:38.690 || 00:08:38.700 || one time Elijah and I had um not closed
00:08:41.089 || 00:08:41.099 || out my contract it was Past final news
00:08:43.130 || 00:08:43.140 || day and I was kind of sweating it I've
00:08:45.050 || 00:08:45.060 || had the money to take it if I needed to
00:08:47.870 || 00:08:47.880 || but my broker said oh no he's very
00:08:50.290 || 00:08:50.300 || casual now I don't worry about it
00:08:53.509 || 00:08:53.519 || we can still you know fix it by buying
00:08:55.850 || 00:08:55.860 || the contract don't worry about it and I
00:08:58.370 || 00:08:58.380 || did but it kind of gave me a lesson in
00:09:00.230 || 00:09:00.240 || real life the real exchange how it
00:09:02.509 || 00:09:02.519 || really works and uh I'm not saying it
00:09:04.430 || 00:09:04.440 || happens in all cases but there's a lot
00:09:06.769 || 00:09:06.779 || that goes on behind the scenes that most
00:09:09.410 || 00:09:09.420 || people aren't aware of and
00:09:12.009 || 00:09:12.019 || um very little of that metal
00:09:15.290 || 00:09:15.300 || is delivered versus the amount of paper
00:09:17.509 || 00:09:17.519 || that is pushed back and forth every day
00:09:18.769 || 00:09:18.779 || you got to remember that during the
00:09:21.170 || 00:09:21.180 || trading Day there might be a big trading
00:09:22.790 || 00:09:22.800 || house that's in and out of the market 10
00:09:25.310 || 00:09:25.320 || times they might be long three times and
00:09:27.710 || 00:09:27.720 || short seven times during the same day I
00:09:30.110 || 00:09:30.120 || mean there's it's a it's a big Casino if
00:09:31.730 || 00:09:31.740 || the algorithms work for you you're
00:09:34.310 || 00:09:34.320 || making money almost every day but we
00:09:35.690 || 00:09:35.700 || look at you know the commitment of
00:09:37.910 || 00:09:37.920 || Traders and it's important you get kind
00:09:39.290 || 00:09:39.300 || of a big picture of you doing that
00:09:41.509 || 00:09:41.519 || looking at the warehouse inventories is
00:09:43.790 || 00:09:43.800 || important you get another good clue of
00:09:45.230 || 00:09:45.240 || what's going on in the physical silver
00:09:48.110 || 00:09:48.120 || market which is key but nonetheless
00:09:51.590 || 00:09:51.600 || there are subtleties that I say some of
00:09:53.090 || 00:09:53.100 || the market participants
00:09:55.850 || 00:09:55.860 || overreact to and make too much of a big
00:09:57.710 || 00:09:57.720 || deal about
00:09:59.810 || 00:09:59.820 || we have a viewer's question here about
00:10:01.310 || 00:10:01.320 || um kind of the comex inventories and
00:10:02.930 || 00:10:02.940 || also the the price of silver how it's
00:10:05.210 || 00:10:05.220 || rising right now after after this low
00:10:08.570 || 00:10:08.580 || they ask could a bank just drain the
00:10:11.509 || 00:10:11.519 || comex at low at a low spot price and
00:10:14.269 || 00:10:14.279 || then when comex is uh has a low
00:10:16.250 || 00:10:16.260 || inventory and the spot price goes up a
00:10:18.829 || 00:10:18.839 || bit as we've already seen then sell it
00:10:20.990 || 00:10:21.000 || back to the comex and then kind of
00:10:22.430 || 00:10:22.440 || profit from that and rinse and repeat
00:10:24.290 || 00:10:24.300 || your perspective on that well yeah can
00:10:26.269 || 00:10:26.279 || they be done all the time I mean
00:10:30.829 || 00:10:30.839 || silver was in a flat mode for 20 years I
00:10:34.910 || 00:10:34.920 || mean from basically 1981 until 2003
00:10:37.790 || 00:10:37.800 || silver just hovered around five dollars
00:10:39.650 || 00:10:39.660 || an ounce and you could make really good
00:10:42.889 || 00:10:42.899 || money by what's called selling puts uh
00:10:44.329 || 00:10:44.339 || you can look it up on the internet when
00:10:46.370 || 00:10:46.380 || selling a put means but basically you're
00:10:48.650 || 00:10:48.660 || just betting that silver is going to
00:10:50.509 || 00:10:50.519 || stay at five bucks but maybe not move up
00:10:53.090 || 00:10:53.100 || so yeah there's lots of ways to do it
00:10:55.190 || 00:10:55.200 || most the time
00:10:58.009 || 00:10:58.019 || um for the questioner it's done
00:11:00.650 || 00:11:00.660 || synthetically it's done with paper but
00:11:03.050 || 00:11:03.060 || yes you could do it physically you bet
00:11:05.030 || 00:11:05.040 || now I did want to get your perspective
00:11:06.650 || 00:11:06.660 || kind of going into the end of the year
00:11:10.490 || 00:11:10.500 || here and looking to 2023 we are seeing
00:11:14.210 || 00:11:14.220 || the FED move slightly from its hawkish
00:11:15.829 || 00:11:15.839 || stance it seems like you know where
00:11:18.110 || 00:11:18.120 || they're slowing the rate hikes we just
00:11:20.509 || 00:11:20.519 || got a couple days ago uh news that the
00:11:23.329 || 00:11:23.339 || fed you know is gonna has raised uh
00:11:25.310 || 00:11:25.320 || rates half a point instead of you know
00:11:26.810 || 00:11:26.820 || the three quarters of a point it had
00:11:31.069 || 00:11:31.079 || been uh uh raising in the recent recent
00:11:35.269 || 00:11:35.279 || uh past year so do you think that fed do
00:11:37.310 || 00:11:37.320 || you think that's a pivot and how do you
00:11:39.590 || 00:11:39.600 || think that is going to impact Metals in
00:11:41.090 || 00:11:41.100 || 2023
00:11:43.069 || 00:11:43.079 || I don't think it's going to have a large
00:11:45.410 || 00:11:45.420 || effect it does always have an effect
00:11:48.170 || 00:11:48.180 || when it's announced sort of a knee-jerk
00:11:50.150 || 00:11:50.160 || reaction and people you know make a big
00:11:51.889 || 00:11:51.899 || fuss about it and it gets in the
00:11:53.690 || 00:11:53.700 || financial press for about three days and
00:11:55.730 || 00:11:55.740 || then it's ignored until the next time
00:11:58.910 || 00:11:58.920 || they raise or don't raise I they're in a
00:12:01.910 || 00:12:01.920 || bind I don't think they can stop raising
00:12:03.769 || 00:12:03.779 || rates until they put in a new system
00:12:06.530 || 00:12:06.540 || they may they may pivot Pal's been
00:12:08.090 || 00:12:08.100 || pretty adamant that they haven't even
00:12:11.090 || 00:12:11.100 || thought about changing inflation uh two
00:12:13.130 || 00:12:13.140 || percent Mark that they continually talk
00:12:15.590 || 00:12:15.600 || about he may change that to four percent
00:12:18.530 || 00:12:18.540 || in the next the half year next you know
00:12:21.530 || 00:12:21.540 || maybe by June of 2023 they'll say well
00:12:23.750 || 00:12:23.760 || continue to raise rates and now we're up
00:12:26.269 || 00:12:26.279 || to you know five and a half percent and
00:12:28.610 || 00:12:28.620 || inflation since come down to six percent
00:12:30.769 || 00:12:30.779 || and we're targeting four now instead of
00:12:33.410 || 00:12:33.420 || two and once we achieve that then you
00:12:35.870 || 00:12:35.880 || know they may pivot but I think a pivot
00:12:38.930 || 00:12:38.940 || is going to send a message to the
00:12:41.150 || 00:12:41.160 || markets that the Federal Reserve is
00:12:43.970 || 00:12:43.980 || giving up on making the dollar worth
00:12:46.310 || 00:12:46.320 || anything and it really signals to the
00:12:48.530 || 00:12:48.540 || market if the Dollar's worthless because
00:12:50.269 || 00:12:50.279 || that's the point where they just keep
00:12:52.069 || 00:12:52.079 || printing even more we've printed so much
00:12:54.590 || 00:12:54.600 || already and it's an exponential function
00:12:57.949 || 00:12:57.959 || so we're at a point where at some place
00:12:59.090 || 00:12:59.100 || in time
00:13:02.030 || 00:13:02.040 || the markets say this is just funny money
00:13:03.170 || 00:13:03.180 || it's not really going to be worth
00:13:05.629 || 00:13:05.639 || anything I'm getting out of it I'm going
00:13:10.430 || 00:13:10.440 || to buy you know Lumber or coal we
00:13:12.470 || 00:13:12.480 || whatever I can get for these dollars
00:13:13.910 || 00:13:13.920 || because I don't trust them anymore
00:13:15.410 || 00:13:15.420 || they're not going to be worth very much
00:13:17.629 || 00:13:17.639 || in the near future haven't reached that
00:13:19.610 || 00:13:19.620 || point yet dollar is Coveted right now
00:13:22.129 || 00:13:22.139 || it's needed by our foreign trading
00:13:24.710 || 00:13:24.720 || partners they are very much in need of
00:13:25.790 || 00:13:25.800 || dollars
00:13:28.009 || 00:13:28.019 || and that will continue until it doesn't
00:13:31.610 || 00:13:31.620 || so it's a complex system but it isn't so
00:13:33.650 || 00:13:33.660 || complex that the basics don't apply and
00:13:35.329 || 00:13:35.339 || we have too much of something it's less
00:13:37.490 || 00:13:37.500 || valuable right now the reason we don't
00:13:39.110 || 00:13:39.120 || have too many dollars although we
00:13:41.329 || 00:13:41.339 || printed so much is because the trading
00:13:43.129 || 00:13:43.139 || partners needed to settle their debts
00:13:46.250 || 00:13:46.260 || and they are in in solvent in a lot of
00:13:48.650 || 00:13:48.660 || cases so in order to remain in business
00:13:50.930 || 00:13:50.940 || they have to borrow more money so what
00:13:52.670 || 00:13:52.680 || they do is they print up their currency
00:13:55.670 || 00:13:55.680 || Swiss Francs for example and send it
00:13:57.350 || 00:13:57.360 || over and do a swap line with the Federal
00:13:59.509 || 00:13:59.519 || Reserve and get dollars for it to solve
00:14:01.009 || 00:14:01.019 || their dollar problem
00:14:03.590 || 00:14:03.600 || but it's all a big shell game back and
00:14:05.750 || 00:14:05.760 || forth and we're getting near the end of
00:14:07.730 || 00:14:07.740 || it you know at some point the street
00:14:09.889 || 00:14:09.899 || vendor that has the shell game going on
00:14:12.350 || 00:14:12.360 || has guessed the end of the day packs up
00:14:15.110 || 00:14:15.120 || his Works he moves on and that's a
00:14:17.329 || 00:14:17.339 || metaphor for where we're headed some
00:14:19.730 || 00:14:19.740 || point the banks are going to have to
00:14:22.190 || 00:14:22.200 || move into a different Realm
00:14:24.829 || 00:14:24.839 || and I don't think they're really totally
00:14:27.410 || 00:14:27.420 || prepared for that uh even though you
00:14:31.190 || 00:14:31.200 || hear the wef and all these others in the
00:14:33.710 || 00:14:33.720 || uh banking Elite talk about you know
00:14:35.569 || 00:14:35.579 || their great reset and you own nothing
00:14:37.790 || 00:14:37.800 || and be happy and you know you'll have a
00:14:39.889 || 00:14:39.899 || central bank digital currency and humans
00:14:42.350 || 00:14:42.360 || can be hacked and all this stuff that's
00:14:45.290 || 00:14:45.300 || out there but uh just because they have
00:14:48.170 || 00:14:48.180 || the ability to Envision this in some
00:14:51.650 || 00:14:51.660 || cases implemented at a small scale uh
00:14:53.569 || 00:14:53.579 || it's a much different animal when you
00:14:56.389 || 00:14:56.399 || get it to a large scale so unfortunately
00:14:58.189 || 00:14:58.199 || though kind of the worst case is you
00:14:59.750 || 00:14:59.760 || have a collapse in the banks collapse
00:15:01.430 || 00:15:01.440 || along with the whole thing
00:15:04.490 || 00:15:04.500 || and they may be wanting that or planning
00:15:07.430 || 00:15:07.440 || that but if that happens
00:15:09.769 || 00:15:09.779 || but then the rebuild is extremely
00:15:11.449 || 00:15:11.459 || difficult although they may have be
00:15:14.629 || 00:15:14.639 || egotistical enough or Brazen enough to
00:15:16.310 || 00:15:16.320 || think that oh well if we take down all
00:15:18.530 || 00:15:18.540 || the banks close them on a Sunday
00:15:20.569 || 00:15:20.579 || afternoon and reopen them a week later
00:15:23.090 || 00:15:23.100 || and get everybody into the Ubi Universe
00:15:25.670 || 00:15:25.680 || basic income and digital dollars or fed
00:15:27.829 || 00:15:27.839 || coins you know and push the button
00:15:29.389 || 00:15:29.399 || everything's reset
00:15:31.730 || 00:15:31.740 || uh and life is good again for us
00:15:33.290 || 00:15:33.300 || elitists
00:15:35.150 || 00:15:35.160 || that may be what they're thinking but I
00:15:37.250 || 00:15:37.260 || don't think it'd be implemented
00:15:39.530 || 00:15:39.540 || nearly in that scenario like I outlined
00:15:42.110 || 00:15:42.120 || I think it'd be much more difficult
00:15:44.269 || 00:15:44.279 || it does seem like there is a movement
00:15:45.829 || 00:15:45.839 || towards a new system obviously we're
00:15:47.389 || 00:15:47.399 || seeing the digital dollar and we've
00:15:48.829 || 00:15:48.839 || touched on that
00:15:50.449 || 00:15:50.459 || um how do you see precious models
00:15:51.889 || 00:15:51.899 || performing in this kind of environment
00:15:54.769 || 00:15:54.779 || If the Fed does kind of as you mentioned
00:15:57.889 || 00:15:57.899 || give up on trying to protect the value
00:16:01.009 || 00:16:01.019 || of the dollar I had to go Skyrocket I
00:16:04.009 || 00:16:04.019 || mean if you look at Monetary history the
00:16:07.189 || 00:16:07.199 || precious metals are most reactionary
00:16:09.710 || 00:16:09.720 || when the governments are really going
00:16:11.870 || 00:16:11.880 || out of business when the governments or
00:16:13.790 || 00:16:13.800 || the or the currency and they're both
00:16:16.850 || 00:16:16.860 || together are failing that's when you see
00:16:18.590 || 00:16:18.600 || the precious metals make these huge
00:16:21.290 || 00:16:21.300 || moves and they're sporadic it doesn't
00:16:22.850 || 00:16:22.860 || happen often not the kind of move I'm
00:16:25.610 || 00:16:25.620 || thinking of and it has to be geared to
00:16:28.129 || 00:16:28.139 || the actual physical economy and the
00:16:30.170 || 00:16:30.180 || financial system being basically
00:16:31.790 || 00:16:31.800 || untrusted
00:16:33.590 || 00:16:33.600 || and that's going to happen in my view
00:16:36.710 || 00:16:36.720 || I've been saying it for years and you
00:16:38.870 || 00:16:38.880 || know my timing hasn't been perfect no
00:16:41.689 || 00:16:41.699 || one knows exactly but I do know history
00:16:43.910 || 00:16:43.920 || and it tends to repeat and the problem
00:16:45.590 || 00:16:45.600 || is this time it's a global phenomena
00:16:47.269 || 00:16:47.279 || because a dollar is the world currency
00:16:50.689 || 00:16:50.699 || so if the dollar fails then there is the
00:16:53.030 || 00:16:53.040 || ability to see gold priced in Dollars
00:16:55.790 || 00:16:55.800 || into the stratosphere I mean if you look
00:16:57.710 || 00:16:57.720 || at it as a thought experiment Elijah and
00:16:59.629 || 00:16:59.639 || you say well all right
00:17:02.810 || 00:17:02.820 || gold accounts for all the misallocation
00:17:04.490 || 00:17:04.500 || of capital has taken place throughout
00:17:06.409 || 00:17:06.419 || the financial system for the last 20
00:17:09.110 || 00:17:09.120 || years and so if you take the amount of
00:17:11.750 || 00:17:11.760 || gold that reportedly we have on the base
00:17:13.309 || 00:17:13.319 || money supply and divide those numbers
00:17:14.809 || 00:17:14.819 || and come up with twenty thousand dollar
00:17:17.449 || 00:17:17.459 || gold so the gold goes to twenty thousand
00:17:19.730 || 00:17:19.740 || has a thought experiment would you trade
00:17:22.610 || 00:17:22.620 || an ounce of gold for 20 000 in Fiat and
00:17:24.470 || 00:17:24.480 || that's the real question because if you
00:17:26.990 || 00:17:27.000 || take the 20 000 Fiat you better be able
00:17:29.570 || 00:17:29.580 || to spend it rather quickly because it
00:17:31.970 || 00:17:31.980 || might be thirty thousand a week later if
00:17:33.710 || 00:17:33.720 || you're in a true exponential function
00:17:37.370 || 00:17:37.380 || which we are so you know getting out
00:17:39.710 || 00:17:39.720 || will be interesting
00:17:41.870 || 00:17:41.880 || um and maybe it won't do that I'm just
00:17:44.210 || 00:17:44.220 || doing an experiment here in my head
00:17:46.669 || 00:17:46.679 || you know what we need to think about is
00:17:49.490 || 00:17:49.500 || when you get to an overvaluation of gold
00:17:50.810 || 00:17:50.820 || what do you want to do with it and I
00:17:53.630 || 00:17:53.640 || would pay direct and with some of the um
00:17:55.430 || 00:17:55.440 || cryptocurrencies that are backed by gold
00:17:57.710 || 00:17:57.720 || or you know you can still contract in
00:17:59.210 || 00:17:59.220 || this country I mean that could buy an
00:18:01.370 || 00:18:01.380 || apartment complex with gold I could buy
00:18:04.430 || 00:18:04.440 || land with gold I could buy uh automobile
00:18:05.990 || 00:18:06.000 || with silver I mean you could still
00:18:07.610 || 00:18:07.620 || contract in this country and you can
00:18:09.950 || 00:18:09.960 || redo it in really all the 50 states you
00:18:11.870 || 00:18:11.880 || have 13 states in the union that have
00:18:13.909 || 00:18:13.919 || already enacted legislation that makes
00:18:16.909 || 00:18:16.919 || it certainty that you can uh transact in
00:18:19.070 || 00:18:19.080 || Precious Metals so I think that's what
00:18:21.470 || 00:18:21.480 || may take place that's what you see
00:18:24.470 || 00:18:24.480 || happens in the Weimar Republic for
00:18:27.110 || 00:18:27.120 || example you see where you know Hotel was
00:18:29.090 || 00:18:29.100 || bought for a few gold coins and that
00:18:31.850 || 00:18:31.860 || type of thing these are rare rare rare
00:18:33.110 || 00:18:33.120 || events
00:18:36.350 || 00:18:36.360 || um but we're getting into that rare rare
00:18:38.930 || 00:18:38.940 || rare event and I do think it's not very
00:18:43.970 || 00:18:43.980 || now as we look kind of towards the more
00:18:46.490 || 00:18:46.500 || near term and we look into next year for
00:18:49.250 || 00:18:49.260 || 2023. uh what is your forecast for both
00:18:51.950 || 00:18:51.960 || gold and silver yeah it's been a tough
00:18:53.810 || 00:18:53.820 || one I mean I like to be right I don't
00:18:56.090 || 00:18:56.100 || like to be over enthusiastic I mean I've
00:18:58.190 || 00:18:58.200 || read all the banks you know what the
00:19:00.230 || 00:19:00.240 || bankers have said I mean
00:19:02.510 || 00:19:02.520 || well other Bankers are saying silver is
00:19:05.330 || 00:19:05.340 || going to be like 1760 for the year I
00:19:07.130 || 00:19:07.140 || think that's absolute completely total
00:19:09.409 || 00:19:09.419 || hog wash and then you've got a couple
00:19:12.350 || 00:19:12.360 || that actually one says fifty dollars in
00:19:16.130 || 00:19:16.140 || um it's only one fifty dollars in 2023
00:19:19.070 || 00:19:19.080 || you know my take is 30 I mean I want to
00:19:22.090 || 00:19:22.100 || see go silver get over 30 and stay there
00:19:24.529 || 00:19:24.539 || and once we do that there's very little
00:19:26.870 || 00:19:26.880 || overhead resistance so everybody that's
00:19:29.870 || 00:19:29.880 || bought silver at 30 or lower uh will be
00:19:31.610 || 00:19:31.620 || in a profit zone so they'll hold they
00:19:34.010 || 00:19:34.020 || will not sell some will but most will
00:19:36.169 || 00:19:36.179 || hold which means any new buying pressure
00:19:38.390 || 00:19:38.400 || will take the 33. and that's the real
00:19:41.330 || 00:19:41.340 || Mark and I know 33 is the magic number
00:19:45.169 || 00:19:45.179 || I'm not one of those people but 33 34
00:19:46.669 || 00:19:46.679 || somewhere in there
00:19:48.770 || 00:19:48.780 || move above that we could get to 50
00:19:51.890 || 00:19:51.900 || pretty quickly so
00:19:53.810 || 00:19:53.820 || um I'm looking for a better year I'm
00:19:56.690 || 00:19:56.700 || looking for a really great one gold I'd
00:19:58.789 || 00:19:58.799 || like to see you know I think we get 2
00:20:01.010 || 00:20:01.020 || 000 in Gold this year if I remember
00:20:03.230 || 00:20:03.240 || right and um
00:20:07.370 || 00:20:07.380 || I think we'll get above 2 000 in Gold I
00:20:11.090 || 00:20:11.100 || don't expect a lot more out of gold than
00:20:14.390 || 00:20:14.400 || maybe 2200 I'm looking at the chart now
00:20:16.450 || 00:20:16.460 || on Kitco yeah we got over
00:20:20.750 || 00:20:20.760 || 2000 in uh early March of this year in
00:20:23.090 || 00:20:23.100 || Gold I don't know these this chart's not
00:20:27.049 || 00:20:27.059 || real clear it's I guess it got up to 20
00:20:29.990 || 00:20:30.000 || 60 or so 2060.
00:20:32.870 || 00:20:32.880 || so I think you'll see gold make a new
00:20:34.669 || 00:20:34.679 || normal high next year
00:20:40.909 || 00:20:40.919 || so 21 22 it's kind of all I'm expecting
00:20:42.409 || 00:20:42.419 || um but you know I have to give the
00:20:44.870 || 00:20:44.880 || caveat Elijah and people get tired of me
00:20:46.310 || 00:20:46.320 || saying that but if there's a really big
00:20:48.230 || 00:20:48.240 || Black Swan
00:20:50.150 || 00:20:50.160 || um you know game's over because once you
00:20:52.370 || 00:20:52.380 || get that Tipping Point where the run to
00:20:55.070 || 00:20:55.080 || Gold begins and the Stampede really
00:20:57.169 || 00:20:57.179 || takes off you just don't want to be
00:20:58.669 || 00:20:58.679 || trampled you want to have your gold in
00:21:01.150 || 00:21:01.160 || hand you want to be early not late
00:21:04.010 || 00:21:04.020 || I think that's so key and again one of
00:21:05.930 || 00:21:05.940 || the reasons to hold precious metals
00:21:07.730 || 00:21:07.740 || probably the main reason is for
00:21:10.310 || 00:21:10.320 || insurance and you definitely want to
00:21:13.430 || 00:21:13.440 || have insurance before any of those you
00:21:15.350 || 00:21:15.360 || know terrible events happen so it's it's
00:21:17.510 || 00:21:17.520 || you know we can have this forecast for
00:21:20.510 || 00:21:20.520 || precious metals and that's only if you
00:21:23.870 || 00:21:23.880 || know next year is a relatively calm year
00:21:25.549 || 00:21:25.559 || and I mean if you look at the last
00:21:27.350 || 00:21:27.360 || couple years we definitely haven't had
00:21:29.750 || 00:21:29.760 || calm times recently but I did want to
00:21:31.010 || 00:21:31.020 || get to
00:21:33.049 || 00:21:33.059 || um another viewer's question here we do
00:21:35.810 || 00:21:35.820 || have one and it's about kind of how we
00:21:37.430 || 00:21:37.440 || talk about you know precious metals and
00:21:40.430 || 00:21:40.440 || as insurance and I know uh a lot of
00:21:42.590 || 00:21:42.600 || people especially in the Eastern World
00:21:44.590 || 00:21:44.600 || understand that and they have understand
00:21:47.750 || 00:21:47.760 || understood precious metals a lot more uh
00:21:49.669 || 00:21:49.679 || than elsewhere but this viewer question
00:21:51.770 || 00:21:51.780 || is wanting to know this viewer is
00:21:53.750 || 00:21:53.760 || wanting to know is there an Arbitrage
00:21:56.149 || 00:21:56.159 || between the Western exchanges and the
00:21:57.770 || 00:21:57.780 || East right now
00:21:59.029 || 00:21:59.039 || ah
00:22:00.970 || 00:22:00.980 || that's a tough one
00:22:03.049 || 00:22:03.059 || yes there is
00:22:05.750 || 00:22:05.760 || um it says I'm connected to most aspects
00:22:07.250 || 00:22:07.260 || of the market so like when you go
00:22:09.950 || 00:22:09.960 || through the smelting and you know
00:22:12.470 || 00:22:12.480 || there's a discount there
00:22:14.450 || 00:22:14.460 || um and yeah there's a little bit of that
00:22:16.909 || 00:22:16.919 || that goes on between uh the market in
00:22:19.010 || 00:22:19.020 || India and the rest of the world and
00:22:20.630 || 00:22:20.640 || there's some tariffs that are involved
00:22:23.570 || 00:22:23.580 || and then if you look at um what happens
00:22:25.490 || 00:22:25.500 || in some of the European markets there's
00:22:27.770 || 00:22:27.780 || a value-added tax sometimes as high as
00:22:30.169 || 00:22:30.179 || 17 percent so when you have those kind
00:22:32.810 || 00:22:32.820 || of add-ons uh there are ways to play
00:22:36.350 || 00:22:36.360 || with it is it official no it's not but
00:22:38.990 || 00:22:39.000 || is it in reality yes it is
00:22:41.870 || 00:22:41.880 || I hope that answers the question
00:22:44.930 || 00:22:44.940 || one last fewer question uh is are you
00:22:47.029 || 00:22:47.039 || bullish on any of the junior miners
00:22:49.789 || 00:22:49.799 || right now well one that I've been real
00:22:54.710 || 00:22:54.720 || bullish on went up 57 today it uh had uh
00:22:56.210 || 00:22:56.220 || an announcement
00:22:59.390 || 00:22:59.400 || oh about a month ago or maybe a little
00:23:01.610 || 00:23:01.620 || less and it had grades that were just
00:23:04.669 || 00:23:04.679 || astronomical it's headed by one of the
00:23:07.190 || 00:23:07.200 || best uh mining teams and I'm that I know
00:23:09.830 || 00:23:09.840 || of and so one of my members said man
00:23:13.070 || 00:23:13.080 || this stock went up 57 today can you do
00:23:14.870 || 00:23:14.880 || an update of course I will
00:23:16.909 || 00:23:16.919 || uh so that's one that I won't name it
00:23:18.350 || 00:23:18.360 || because I reserve that you know people
00:23:23.090 || 00:23:23.100 || pay me for my insights but um I assume a
00:23:27.169 || 00:23:27.179 || silver went up I think 24 today so some
00:23:28.970 || 00:23:28.980 || of these juniors are reacting for
00:23:30.950 || 00:23:30.960 || whatever reason
00:23:33.110 || 00:23:33.120 || um you know maybe somebody saw my video
00:23:34.549 || 00:23:34.559 || on uh
00:23:36.890 || 00:23:36.900 || on this particular one I just mentioned
00:23:39.890 || 00:23:39.900 || it went up 57 I made a video for my
00:23:42.350 || 00:23:42.360 || members only and talked about
00:23:44.690 || 00:23:44.700 || how undervalued it is one of my members
00:23:46.909 || 00:23:46.919 || said you know you've had this stock for
00:23:48.950 || 00:23:48.960 || so long it hasn't done anything and I'm
00:23:52.310 || 00:23:52.320 || you know kind of tired of you know why
00:23:54.049 || 00:23:54.059 || would you hold this stock
00:23:56.090 || 00:23:56.100 || and so I explained to him that these
00:23:57.950 || 00:23:57.960 || penny stocks are like a long-term call
00:23:59.630 || 00:23:59.640 || option as long as you pick the right
00:24:03.110 || 00:24:03.120 || ones and that uh regular option you have
00:24:05.149 || 00:24:05.159 || a time Decay so you buy it and it has
00:24:07.010 || 00:24:07.020 || value until the time runs out and then
00:24:08.090 || 00:24:08.100 || you got to buy another one so it
00:24:09.710 || 00:24:09.720 || actually drains your Capital unless
00:24:11.870 || 00:24:11.880 || you're very good at timing it whereas
00:24:13.789 || 00:24:13.799 || with the right Junior and I say right
00:24:16.370 || 00:24:16.380 || junior or Juniors and I don't get them
00:24:18.169 || 00:24:18.179 || all right so let me say that on the
00:24:19.310 || 00:24:19.320 || record
00:24:21.710 || 00:24:21.720 || um you can just wait man this is a
00:24:24.230 || 00:24:24.240 || particular case where you know it did a
00:24:25.909 || 00:24:25.919 || lot better than a treasury bill in one
00:24:27.890 || 00:24:27.900 || day now it's going to hold on the gains
00:24:29.210 || 00:24:29.220 || or not I don't know I actually haven't
00:24:31.190 || 00:24:31.200 || had time to look at um
00:24:33.169 || 00:24:33.179 || other than the chart what happened that
00:24:34.669 || 00:24:34.679 || will call management I'll probably do an
00:24:37.370 || 00:24:37.380 || update most of my updates lately have
00:24:38.570 || 00:24:38.580 || been um
00:24:41.930 || 00:24:41.940 || where I get the uh the management of the
00:24:44.029 || 00:24:44.039 || company to do a video with me and I put
00:24:46.010 || 00:24:46.020 || it behind the paywall so that my members
00:24:49.490 || 00:24:49.500 || get to see it basically firsthand and I
00:24:51.230 || 00:24:51.240 || usually give them a few softballs but I
00:24:52.610 || 00:24:52.620 || throw a few hardballs at them as well
00:24:55.730 || 00:24:55.740 || and uh gives my viewers and my members a
00:24:59.090 || 00:24:59.100 || maybe a better appreciation for not only
00:25:00.590 || 00:25:00.600 || the level of commitment that I have for
00:25:02.990 || 00:25:03.000 || them but also more insight and rather
00:25:05.210 || 00:25:05.220 || than me saying it second hand they hear
00:25:06.890 || 00:25:06.900 || it directly so I think that's a pretty
00:25:09.890 || 00:25:09.900 || good service I do safely myself
00:25:12.770 || 00:25:12.780 || and I think with the junior miners it's
00:25:15.950 || 00:25:15.960 || really important to you know know the
00:25:19.370 || 00:25:19.380 || team do they have a a record of success
00:25:21.350 || 00:25:21.360 || as well the members of the team there
00:25:24.230 || 00:25:24.240 || because you know it's Junior miners can
00:25:26.750 || 00:25:26.760 || be explosive in their values and some of
00:25:28.909 || 00:25:28.919 || them can fall to zero as well right yeah
00:25:31.190 || 00:25:31.200 || there's a lot most of them go to zero
00:25:34.010 || 00:25:34.020 || that's the problem but in a hot Market
00:25:36.470 || 00:25:36.480 || when everybody wants in the gold and
00:25:39.289 || 00:25:39.299 || silver even the dogs will fly pigs will
00:25:41.930 || 00:25:41.940 || fly I mean and that's the way the
00:25:43.730 || 00:25:43.740 || markets work I mean I'm not against it
00:25:45.950 || 00:25:45.960 || really I mean morally I might be a
00:25:48.230 || 00:25:48.240 || little perturbed but it's the way
00:25:50.510 || 00:25:50.520 || markets work and it's true of anything a
00:25:52.669 || 00:25:52.679 || tech sector I mean dogs five crypto look
00:25:53.810 || 00:25:53.820 || I mean there's these things that have
00:25:55.909 || 00:25:55.919 || absolutely zero intrinsic value but
00:25:57.590 || 00:25:57.600 || people say they are because they have a
00:26:00.110 || 00:26:00.120 || cute name and the price goes up just
00:26:01.730 || 00:26:01.740 || because the price goes up just being the
00:26:04.250 || 00:26:04.260 || value is there uh so that's kind of the
00:26:05.810 || 00:26:05.820 || world we're in especially at the end of
00:26:08.090 || 00:26:08.100 || the Great inflations you see all kinds
00:26:09.529 || 00:26:09.539 || of misallocation of capital you see
00:26:11.029 || 00:26:11.039 || people really wanting to get rich quick
00:26:13.010 || 00:26:13.020 || you see all kinds of schemes and fads
00:26:14.570 || 00:26:14.580 || and Ponzi schemes and all kinds of
00:26:16.430 || 00:26:16.440 || things that take place and that's just
00:26:18.049 || 00:26:18.059 || another indicator for my fundamental
00:26:19.909 || 00:26:19.919 || view that what I said is accurate that
00:26:21.890 || 00:26:21.900 || we are a place that happens very rarely
00:26:24.710 || 00:26:24.720 || and there'll be an explosion in the
00:26:27.409 || 00:26:27.419 || paper price of the metals to make up for
00:26:29.990 || 00:26:30.000 || all of the shenanigans that have gone on
00:26:31.610 || 00:26:31.620 || throughout the financial sector for for
00:26:35.570 || 00:26:35.580 || a long time uh I'll just say the last 20
00:26:37.130 || 00:26:37.140 || years you could say from the time the
00:26:39.409 || 00:26:39.419 || gold when it was closed but we were
00:26:41.210 || 00:26:41.220 || really doing Shenanigans and that's why
00:26:43.070 || 00:26:43.080 || the gold window was closed because we're
00:26:45.409 || 00:26:45.419 || making up more Federal Reserve notes and
00:26:47.029 || 00:26:47.039 || it was going to back it up and France
00:26:50.210 || 00:26:50.220 || called our Bluff along with UK so
00:26:51.830 || 00:26:51.840 || we'll have to leave it with that David

00:27:44.390 || 00:27:44.400 || the US does not a Cyber attack it's just
