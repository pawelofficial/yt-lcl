00:02:30.050 || 00:02:30.060 || historically analogous years to what's
00:02:31.430 || 00:02:31.440 || ahead and I think it's very important
00:02:33.110 || 00:02:33.120 || for people to understand and I think my

00:03:14.809 || 00:03:14.819 || you know just earlier this week with the
00:03:16.550 || 00:03:16.560 || macro cast and so I'd really encourage
00:03:18.530 || 00:03:18.540 || everybody to at least consider joining
00:03:20.270 || 00:03:20.280 || tfmr and here's a way to kind of save a
00:03:22.490 || 00:03:22.500 || few bucks to see if it's worth it your
00:03:24.290 || 00:03:24.300 || forecast for this year as you mentioned
00:03:26.089 || 00:03:26.099 || it looks like this year is going to
00:03:29.690 || 00:03:29.700 || parallel uh 2010 and 2019 for the medal
00:03:32.089 || 00:03:32.099 || so it should be pretty pretty good what
00:03:34.070 || 00:03:34.080 || is your perspective on that well and
00:03:36.890 || 00:03:36.900 || that's the the historical analogy in
00:03:39.110 || 00:03:39.120 || that you know we begin this year
00:03:41.330 || 00:03:41.340 || and even this week as a record this
00:03:43.309 || 00:03:43.319 || we've had you know a couple of different
00:03:45.289 || 00:03:45.299 || fed statements come out you know fed
00:03:47.030 || 00:03:47.040 || Governors and say oh yeah we're going to
00:03:48.770 || 00:03:48.780 || keep on hiking you know and all this
00:03:50.630 || 00:03:50.640 || kind of stuff and the latest
00:03:52.729 || 00:03:52.739 || guesstimates of interest rates from the
00:03:54.289 || 00:03:54.299 || you know the eight figure Wall Street
00:03:56.449 || 00:03:56.459 || Economist guys or you know four and five
00:03:58.070 || 00:03:58.080 || percent on the 10-year note and all this
00:04:00.170 || 00:04:00.180 || stuff and we've seen this before man
00:04:02.089 || 00:04:02.099 || this is not complicated everything
00:04:05.030 || 00:04:05.040 || changed after the financial crisis in
00:04:07.610 || 00:04:07.620 || 2009 when we began when fed began QE
00:04:09.110 || 00:04:09.120 || that changed everything
00:04:11.509 || 00:04:11.519 || and so as we entered 2010 That was
00:04:13.850 || 00:04:13.860 || supposed to be a one-off the economy was
00:04:14.929 || 00:04:14.939 || going to be soaring they were never
00:04:17.509 || 00:04:17.519 || going to do this again the economy began
00:04:19.550 || 00:04:19.560 || to falter in the first half of 2010 and
00:04:20.870 || 00:04:20.880 || into the third quarter and what happened
00:04:24.530 || 00:04:24.540 || by November of 2010 here came QE2
00:04:26.270 || 00:04:26.280 || well the metals went sideways for the
00:04:27.770 || 00:04:27.780 || first half of that year and then in the
00:04:29.749 || 00:04:29.759 || back half silver went from 18 to 30 and
00:04:31.490 || 00:04:31.500 || gold took off as well
00:04:33.950 || 00:04:33.960 || and then you know what happened in 2011.
00:04:36.409 || 00:04:36.419 || okay so now fast forward to 2018 same
00:04:38.930 || 00:04:38.940 || old garbage uh the fed's gonna hike you
00:04:41.030 || 00:04:41.040 || know and Jan Hodges a golden sacks the
00:04:42.650 || 00:04:42.660 || rates are going to keep going higher and
00:04:44.330 || 00:04:44.340 || fed was talking about three or four more
00:04:47.450 || 00:04:47.460 || rate hikes in 2019 and what happened the
00:04:50.810 || 00:04:50.820 || economy faltered and by summer of 19 the
00:04:52.310 || 00:04:52.320 || FED started cutting
00:04:54.230 || 00:04:54.240 || and the 10-year note went from Two and a
00:04:56.030 || 00:04:56.040 || half down to one and a half not to four
00:04:57.530 || 00:04:57.540 || and a half or five like everybody was
00:04:58.909 || 00:04:58.919 || saying and what happened the metals went
00:05:00.230 || 00:05:00.240 || sideways for the first half of the year
00:05:01.790 || 00:05:01.800 || and then they took off
00:05:03.110 || 00:05:03.120 || and so it's gonna be really really
00:05:04.490 || 00:05:04.500 || important for people to understand that
00:05:06.710 || 00:05:06.720 || that's exactly where we are again even
00:05:08.450 || 00:05:08.460 || Jan hasis who still works for Goldman
00:05:10.129 || 00:05:10.139 || Sachs is still saying four and a half on
00:05:11.150 || 00:05:11.160 || the tenure
00:05:12.830 || 00:05:12.840 || and it's down to three and a half today
00:05:14.930 || 00:05:14.940 || as we speak and it's going to two and a
00:05:17.689 || 00:05:17.699 || half this year not four and a half
00:05:19.550 || 00:05:19.560 || and the dollar is going to fall as the
00:05:22.730 || 00:05:22.740 || FED starts cutting eventually by Fall
00:05:24.290 || 00:05:24.300 || they'll be talking about QE again
00:05:26.390 || 00:05:26.400 || because the economy they've overreacted
00:05:27.770 || 00:05:27.780 || they don't know how badly they've
00:05:29.330 || 00:05:29.340 || overreacted they've driving the economy
00:05:30.590 || 00:05:30.600 || in the ditches which is what the
00:05:32.689 || 00:05:32.699 || economic data is already showing
00:05:36.110 || 00:05:36.120 || and just like 2010 and 2019 the medals
00:05:37.850 || 00:05:37.860 || will see this and really begin to react
00:05:39.350 || 00:05:39.360 || by summertime
00:05:41.029 || 00:05:41.039 || and if you're not patient if you're not
00:05:42.529 || 00:05:42.539 || aware of all this you're not you get
00:05:44.029 || 00:05:44.039 || caught up in the menu today of the ups
00:05:45.230 || 00:05:45.240 || and downs every day you're going to
00:05:47.570 || 00:05:47.580 || probably screw yourself out of it you'll
00:05:49.790 || 00:05:49.800 || get distracted and wrong footed but if
00:05:51.950 || 00:05:51.960 || you are patient you'll get that same run
00:05:56.090 || 00:05:56.100 || like we'd gotten 10 and 19 and then a
00:05:58.670 || 00:05:58.680 || reminder the real action then took place
00:06:00.469 || 00:06:00.479 || in 11 and 20.
00:06:02.629 || 00:06:02.639 || which you know again would set us up for
00:06:04.790 || 00:06:04.800 || a really booming big boom in 24 so
00:06:07.070 || 00:06:07.080 || that's why I think it's so important uh
00:06:08.450 || 00:06:08.460 || for people to be paying attention and
00:06:10.550 || 00:06:10.560 || understand the macro at this point
00:06:12.590 || 00:06:12.600 || no when it comes to I guess the first
00:06:14.270 || 00:06:14.280 || six months is you're saying it might be
00:06:16.490 || 00:06:16.500 || a bit frustrating uh for the medals
00:06:18.529 || 00:06:18.539 || Market but then the next six months the
00:06:19.909 || 00:06:19.919 || last six months of the year is going to
00:06:23.330 || 00:06:23.340 || be uh quite quite good here so it sounds
00:06:25.010 || 00:06:25.020 || like kind of an accumulation period
00:06:27.230 || 00:06:27.240 || maybe for people the first six months of
00:06:31.309 || 00:06:31.319 || [Music]
00:06:34.249 || 00:06:34.259 || the current pattern on the chart uh we
00:06:36.650 || 00:06:36.660 || have been I guess a technical term is
00:06:39.890 || 00:06:39.900 || consolidating uh flagging is what a
00:06:42.170 || 00:06:42.180 || technical analysts like to call it on
00:06:44.090 || 00:06:44.100 || both gold and silver ever since that big
00:06:45.950 || 00:06:45.960 || rally in 2020
00:06:48.770 || 00:06:48.780 || gold has essentially been between 1700
00:06:52.010 || 00:06:52.020 || and 2000 broke out falsely the upside a
00:06:53.510 || 00:06:53.520 || couple times broke down this fall
00:06:55.249 || 00:06:55.259 || falsely announced I mean Square in the
00:06:57.050 || 00:06:57.060 || middle it's like 1850 right
00:06:58.969 || 00:06:58.979 || it was right in the middle uh and silver
00:07:01.550 || 00:07:01.560 || is the same thing silver been bounded by
00:07:04.070 || 00:07:04.080 || 22 and 28 it banged out about a couple
00:07:07.670 || 00:07:07.680 || of times above 28. fell below 22 and now
00:07:09.409 || 00:07:09.419 || it's right back in the middle at 24.
00:07:12.290 || 00:07:12.300 || it'll probably chop continue to chop
00:07:15.170 || 00:07:15.180 || sideways because the FED I mean even
00:07:16.730 || 00:07:16.740 || this morning these goons are out there
00:07:17.990 || 00:07:18.000 || saying oh yeah we're definitely going to
00:07:19.610 || 00:07:19.620 || keep hiking you know well above five
00:07:22.430 || 00:07:22.440 || percent and the economy is in in the
00:07:23.870 || 00:07:23.880 || ditch
00:07:25.330 || 00:07:25.340 || and so
00:07:27.589 || 00:07:27.599 || here's the thing Elijah
00:07:29.870 || 00:07:29.880 || they waited I mean you look at these
00:07:31.010 || 00:07:31.020 || goons now they're sitting there saying
00:07:32.210 || 00:07:32.220 || oh there's no way we're going to cut
00:07:34.790 || 00:07:34.800 || rates in 2023. I mean cash Kerry just
00:07:36.529 || 00:07:36.539 || said that yesterday Thursday the 5th
00:07:39.830 || 00:07:39.840 || well if you just rewind 18 months that
00:07:42.469 || 00:07:42.479 || same guy was saying there's no way we're
00:07:45.110 || 00:07:45.120 || hiking rates until 2023
00:07:46.909 || 00:07:46.919 || so why did anybody takes these people
00:07:49.670 || 00:07:49.680 || seriously they're always reacting
00:07:52.850 || 00:07:52.860 || they're never being proactive and so
00:07:55.370 || 00:07:55.380 || they waited a hike inflation got to 10
00:07:58.249 || 00:07:58.259 || then they went crazy I mean they they
00:07:59.930 || 00:07:59.940 || waited you know through the war that
00:08:01.730 || 00:08:01.740 || kind of threw him a screwball they
00:08:02.809 || 00:08:02.819 || didn't know what to do when the war
00:08:05.089 || 00:08:05.099 || started back in February then they went
00:08:07.370 || 00:08:07.380 || crazy with all these 75 base Point rate
00:08:10.790 || 00:08:10.800 || hikes they can no way measure the damage
00:08:13.490 || 00:08:13.500 || they've done economically and as we
00:08:15.110 || 00:08:15.120 || record this the metals are soaring today
00:08:16.550 || 00:08:16.560 || and the Dollar's down Prime not because
00:08:18.050 || 00:08:18.060 || the jobs report
00:08:20.330 || 00:08:20.340 || but because these purchasing manager
00:08:22.850 || 00:08:22.860 || indices whether they're measured by s p
00:08:26.029 || 00:08:26.039 || Global or by ISM are now all four the
00:08:28.730 || 00:08:28.740 || two manufacturing pmis are the two
00:08:31.309 || 00:08:31.319 || service sector pmis all four are sharply
00:08:33.529 || 00:08:33.539 || down and negative and Below 50. anything
00:08:36.709 || 00:08:36.719 || below 50 is contraction territory the
00:08:38.990 || 00:08:39.000 || official PMI is put out by Regional fed
00:08:40.969 || 00:08:40.979 || branches like Chicago Philadelphia New
00:08:43.430 || 00:08:43.440 || York they're all negative as well those
00:08:46.370 || 00:08:46.380 || fed pmis when they've gone negative
00:08:49.550 || 00:08:49.560 || before have that has preceded eight of
00:08:52.190 || 00:08:52.200 || the last eight recessions okay so
00:08:53.690 || 00:08:53.700 || they're batting a thousand
00:08:55.370 || 00:08:55.380 || but the FED oh we're just gonna keep
00:08:57.710 || 00:08:57.720 || hiking I mean they have no idea I mean
00:08:58.970 || 00:08:58.980 || inflation's obviously coming down so
00:09:01.790 || 00:09:01.800 || anyway the key to all this the economy
00:09:03.949 || 00:09:03.959 || goes in the ditch the data is just going
00:09:05.150 || 00:09:05.160 || to get worse and worse through the first
00:09:07.550 || 00:09:07.560 || and second quarter and by June they'll
00:09:09.410 || 00:09:09.420 || either be cutting rates which again
00:09:10.970 || 00:09:10.980 || nobody expects or at least be talking
00:09:12.470 || 00:09:12.480 || about it
00:09:14.509 || 00:09:14.519 || and that's when
00:09:16.009 || 00:09:16.019 || we break out to the upside of those
00:09:18.290 || 00:09:18.300 || ranges the spec money comes rushing in
00:09:21.530 || 00:09:21.540 || and uh and it gets get pretty exciting
00:09:24.050 || 00:09:24.060 || again for the medals and you've
00:09:25.970 || 00:09:25.980 || mentioned how the FED really has to
00:09:27.590 || 00:09:27.600 || become the buyer of Last Resort because
00:09:29.329 || 00:09:29.339 || more countries are going to be moving
00:09:31.130 || 00:09:31.140 || away from the dollar and not purchasing
00:09:33.590 || 00:09:33.600 || U.S bonds can you expand on that well
00:09:37.490 || 00:09:37.500 || yeah I mean there in the past right all
00:09:38.930 || 00:09:38.940 || these central banks were buying bonds
00:09:41.090 || 00:09:41.100 || trying to keep rates down
00:09:43.730 || 00:09:43.740 || um that has led them all off of a cliff
00:09:46.850 || 00:09:46.860 || and so now the bank of Japan totally
00:09:48.410 || 00:09:48.420 || focused on supporting their own bond
00:09:51.769 || 00:09:51.779 || market 180 billion dollars a month in
00:09:53.329 || 00:09:53.339 || December the biggest month they've ever
00:09:54.110 || 00:09:54.120 || had
00:09:55.610 || 00:09:55.620 || so it's not like they're supporting a
00:09:58.130 || 00:09:58.140 || U.S bond market the bank of England same
00:09:59.449 || 00:09:59.459 || thing you know the Russians and the
00:10:01.310 || 00:10:01.320 || Chinese aren't buying treasuries anymore
00:10:04.730 || 00:10:04.740 || so the FED is for now longer rates are
00:10:06.889 || 00:10:06.899 || coming down 10-year notes already down
00:10:09.050 || 00:10:09.060 || 30 basis points in the first four
00:10:11.110 || 00:10:11.120 || trading days here at 2023 because
00:10:13.250 || 00:10:13.260 || they're get the fed's getting some help
00:10:15.829 || 00:10:15.839 || by regular investors and hedge funds and
00:10:17.329 || 00:10:17.339 || cash on the sidelines going we're going
00:10:18.710 || 00:10:18.720 || into recession and the fed's going to be
00:10:20.090 || 00:10:20.100 || cutting in later this year three and a
00:10:22.490 || 00:10:22.500 || half on a 10-year notes pretty good deal
00:10:24.350 || 00:10:24.360 || but at the end of the day the FED has to
00:10:25.790 || 00:10:25.800 || be the buyer of Last Resort just like
00:10:27.230 || 00:10:27.240 || the bank of Japan's the buyer of Last
00:10:29.570 || 00:10:29.580 || Resort for for their bond market you
00:10:31.370 || 00:10:31.380 || know and around the world
00:10:33.050 || 00:10:33.060 || we've already we're already running
00:10:35.050 || 00:10:35.060 || again a more than trillion dollar
00:10:37.430 || 00:10:37.440 || deficit here in the U.S
00:10:39.769 || 00:10:39.779 || with interest rates spiking the way they
00:10:43.190 || 00:10:43.200 || did in 2022 the interest on the national
00:10:45.230 || 00:10:45.240 || debt that line item
00:10:48.350 || 00:10:48.360 || well if there was a budget the line item
00:10:51.170 || 00:10:51.180 || on the U.S budget would be almost 800
00:10:54.069 || 00:10:54.079 || billion dollars a year this fiscal year
00:10:57.230 || 00:10:57.240 || in servicing costs interest costs on the
00:10:58.970 || 00:10:58.980 || national debt the rates keep going
00:11:00.230 || 00:11:00.240 || higher it's going to go to over a
00:11:02.750 || 00:11:02.760 || trillion and pretty soon that'll exceed
00:11:04.250 || 00:11:04.260 || defense spending you know social
00:11:06.170 || 00:11:06.180 || spending and then the FED just has to
00:11:07.490 || 00:11:07.500 || print even more
00:11:09.470 || 00:11:09.480 || to keep the wheel spinning
00:11:13.850 || 00:11:13.860 || so this idea I get I mean like we
00:11:15.470 || 00:11:15.480 || laughed I laughed at this yacht I picked
00:11:17.329 || 00:11:17.339 || on yon hotsius because I'm you know the
00:11:19.310 || 00:11:19.320 || guy's a partner at Goldman Sachs and
00:11:21.350 || 00:11:21.360 || he's making probably 10 million dollars
00:11:24.050 || 00:11:24.060 || a year if not more and he's always wrong
00:11:27.290 || 00:11:27.300 || and it you know four years ago he said
00:11:30.290 || 00:11:30.300 || you know with the 10-year note it's two
00:11:31.490 || 00:11:31.500 || and a half three percent he said it was
00:11:32.569 || 00:11:32.579 || going to four and a half because the Fed
00:11:33.769 || 00:11:33.779 || was going to keep hiking and he's saying
00:11:36.170 || 00:11:36.180 || the same thing now he was wrong then he
00:11:39.170 || 00:11:39.180 || and his ill gonna be wrong now and it's
00:11:41.329 || 00:11:41.339 || just so important
00:11:44.210 || 00:11:44.220 || for people investors in general but
00:11:45.710 || 00:11:45.720 || particularly those invested and
00:11:47.030 || 00:11:47.040 || interested in the precious metal space
00:11:49.250 || 00:11:49.260 || to think for yourself man don't just
00:11:51.710 || 00:11:51.720 || swallow what the mouthpieces of the
00:11:53.210 || 00:11:53.220 || mainstream media and you know what your
00:11:55.310 || 00:11:55.320 || stock broker you know reads off of you
00:11:57.110 || 00:11:57.120 || know what his bank is in his investment
00:11:58.850 || 00:11:58.860 || firm is telling him to say
00:12:01.690 || 00:12:01.700 || think for yourself and trust yourself
00:12:04.790 || 00:12:04.800 || and prepare for again
00:12:06.829 || 00:12:06.839 || uh a year that is going to catch a lot
00:12:08.990 || 00:12:09.000 || of people by surprise judging by what
00:12:11.690 || 00:12:11.700 || expectations are as the year begins I
00:12:13.550 || 00:12:13.560 || think last year definitely got a lot of
00:12:15.769 || 00:12:15.779 || people by surprise with you know the
00:12:18.650 || 00:12:18.660 || stock market down quite a bit we had
00:12:20.509 || 00:12:20.519 || been in a bull market and you know a
00:12:23.150 || 00:12:23.160 || blip uh a crash during covid but it
00:12:25.130 || 00:12:25.140 || recovered real quickly so for so many
00:12:27.050 || 00:12:27.060 || years we had just been in a stock Bowl
00:12:29.210 || 00:12:29.220 || market and here we are all the indices
00:12:31.730 || 00:12:31.740 || down pretty much and you've mentioned
00:12:33.530 || 00:12:33.540 || also how there's probably going to be a
00:12:35.509 || 00:12:35.519 || lot of geopolitical there are a lot of
00:12:39.170 || 00:12:39.180 || geopolitical wild cards uh in 2023 we
00:12:41.509 || 00:12:41.519 || had that in 2022 with the the Ukraine
00:12:43.790 || 00:12:43.800 || war what are a couple things that you
00:12:45.829 || 00:12:45.839 || know may happen may not happen but could
00:12:47.930 || 00:12:47.940 || really just put a little chaos into the
00:12:49.790 || 00:12:49.800 || system this year first of all that that
00:12:52.790 || 00:12:52.800 || ongoing War I mean is an existential
00:12:55.250 || 00:12:55.260 || threat to everybody and I would imagine
00:12:58.250 || 00:12:58.260 || Elijah the last time we spoke uh as we
00:13:01.250 || 00:13:01.260 || were recapping 2022 I I don't know if I
00:13:02.629 || 00:13:02.639 || told you this but I told about everybody
00:13:05.769 || 00:13:05.779 || else this then the biggest event
00:13:09.650 || 00:13:09.660 || financially of 2022 was the first week
00:13:10.790 || 00:13:10.800 || of March
00:13:12.949 || 00:13:12.959 || first weekend of March I should stay
00:13:16.850 || 00:13:16.860 || when the U.S froze and in a sense
00:13:19.610 || 00:13:19.620 || confiscated Russia's non-domestically
00:13:21.230 || 00:13:21.240 || held foreign currency reserves which
00:13:23.569 || 00:13:23.579 || about 350 billion dollars but also
00:13:25.329 || 00:13:25.339 || kicked him out of Swift
00:13:28.910 || 00:13:28.920 || and as we look back you know five years
00:13:30.110 || 00:13:30.120 || from now or what ten years from now
00:13:31.670 || 00:13:31.680 || whatever that will be the biggest
00:13:33.230 || 00:13:33.240 || financial event not only of this year
00:13:34.430 || 00:13:34.440 || but probably every year going forward
00:13:37.730 || 00:13:37.740 || because what that's proved once and for
00:13:42.050 || 00:13:42.060 || all is if you as a Sovereign Nation have
00:13:43.730 || 00:13:43.740 || interest and I'm not saying I approval
00:13:45.889 || 00:13:45.899 || what Russia did or approval you know
00:13:47.210 || 00:13:47.220 || that what China does or anything like
00:13:48.650 || 00:13:48.660 || that but you know they're going to do
00:13:50.150 || 00:13:50.160 || act in what they perceive to be their
00:13:51.530 || 00:13:51.540 || own best interests
00:13:53.930 || 00:13:53.940 || and if you as a Sovereign Nation
00:13:56.030 || 00:13:56.040 || acting in what you for whatever reason
00:13:57.350 || 00:13:57.360 || perceive your own best interest is
00:13:59.269 || 00:13:59.279 || somehow sideways with the U.S
00:14:05.690 || 00:14:05.700 || well wait a second you know you're gonna
00:14:07.970 || 00:14:07.980 || go We're not gonna look we've got our
00:14:09.230 || 00:14:09.240 || own interests that we're worried about
00:14:12.949 || 00:14:12.959 || here and so that really sped up
00:14:17.449 || 00:14:17.459 || this D dollarization thing this eventual
00:14:20.329 || 00:14:20.339 || monetary alternative
00:14:23.690 || 00:14:23.700 || to you know a a a parallel system to the
00:14:25.009 || 00:14:25.019 || dollar whatever
00:14:27.650 || 00:14:27.660 || for these bricks if you will countries
00:14:30.110 || 00:14:30.120 || to use now speed up you know this is a
00:14:31.790 || 00:14:31.800 || process been going on for 15 years so
00:14:33.590 || 00:14:33.600 || speed up you know does it go from one
00:14:35.030 || 00:14:35.040 || mile an hour to two
00:14:37.250 || 00:14:37.260 || you know you can't say for sure that
00:14:38.750 || 00:14:38.760 || that you know alternative is going to be
00:14:40.370 || 00:14:40.380 || offered this year but it definitely head
00:14:41.569 || 00:14:41.579 || in that direction so maybe it will maybe
00:14:43.250 || 00:14:43.260 || there'll be more signs of that you know
00:14:45.530 || 00:14:45.540 || why is it that gold besides all this
00:14:46.670 || 00:14:46.680 || macro staff
00:14:48.290 || 00:14:48.300 || I mean very first day of the year first
00:14:49.970 || 00:14:49.980 || two days of the year gold was up 30 some
00:14:52.189 || 00:14:52.199 || odd dollars while the dollar was up
00:14:53.810 || 00:14:53.820 || you hear all these reports of central
00:14:55.550 || 00:14:55.560 || banks buying gold
00:14:59.030 || 00:14:59.040 || you know maybe there's this
00:15:00.710 || 00:15:00.720 || you know this movement that really takes
00:15:03.050 || 00:15:03.060 || hold this year of of gold demand
00:15:05.090 || 00:15:05.100 || actually beginning to impact that that
00:15:08.090 || 00:15:08.100 || Futures price so those those
00:15:10.970 || 00:15:10.980 || geopolitical factors and how they play
00:15:13.310 || 00:15:13.320 || out are going to play a key role too and
00:15:15.650 || 00:15:15.660 || again that's what that's what's all the
00:15:17.870 || 00:15:17.880 || challenge of of running a precious metal
00:15:19.850 || 00:15:19.860 || site because I mean if you're just a
00:15:22.129 || 00:15:22.139 || trading site you know you can watch dots
00:15:23.509 || 00:15:23.519 || on a screen and all that kind of stuff
00:15:24.889 || 00:15:24.899 || but if you're going to focus only on the
00:15:26.269 || 00:15:26.279 || precious metals and we've got to watch
00:15:29.810 || 00:15:29.820 || everything right oh you know that and
00:15:32.210 || 00:15:32.220 || um yeah those are geopolitics is going
00:15:34.370 || 00:15:34.380 || to play a big role this year too as we
00:15:35.990 || 00:15:36.000 || mentioned you know the stock market take
00:15:38.870 || 00:15:38.880 || a took a big hit last year uh If the Fed
00:15:40.790 || 00:15:40.800 || does reverse what do you see happening
00:15:42.889 || 00:15:42.899 || to the stock market this year well you
00:15:44.870 || 00:15:44.880 || see that in the action this week
00:15:47.509 || 00:15:47.519 || every time there's any hint
00:15:49.189 || 00:15:49.199 || um of what we talk about about that
00:15:52.069 || 00:15:52.079 || macro shift coming faster than people
00:15:54.290 || 00:15:54.300 || expected the FED pivot whatever
00:15:56.750 || 00:15:56.760 || the the stock market rallies takes off
00:15:58.550 || 00:15:58.560 || goes to the upside
00:16:00.170 || 00:16:00.180 || um because they're thinking hey hey more
00:16:01.670 || 00:16:01.680 || free money
00:16:03.829 || 00:16:03.839 || right and everybody probably listening
00:16:05.389 || 00:16:05.399 || to seeing those charts you know plotting
00:16:07.850 || 00:16:07.860 || the s p with the FED balance sheet you
00:16:09.350 || 00:16:09.360 || know and they just rise with time and
00:16:12.590 || 00:16:12.600 || then Decline and Rise with time and
00:16:16.310 || 00:16:16.320 || um so depending on how soon that idea
00:16:18.410 || 00:16:18.420 || takes hold I'm and then once it gets
00:16:19.730 || 00:16:19.740 || into place again I'm sure the stock
00:16:22.090 || 00:16:22.100 || market will rally again in the meantime
00:16:25.430 || 00:16:25.440 || you know the fed their their Governors
00:16:27.170 || 00:16:27.180 || the former governors like Bill Dudley
00:16:28.670 || 00:16:28.680 || have been telling everybody now for nine
00:16:30.290 || 00:16:30.300 || months that they want to inflict losses
00:16:32.030 || 00:16:32.040 || that they want to hit the demand side of
00:16:34.009 || 00:16:34.019 || the supply demand equation
00:16:35.930 || 00:16:35.940 || to get
00:16:37.970 || 00:16:37.980 || um inflation under control
00:16:40.310 || 00:16:40.320 || so I you know and and you know and with
00:16:43.069 || 00:16:43.079 || the economy slowing down you know that
00:16:46.129 || 00:16:46.139 || affects the E the earnings part of the
00:16:48.110 || 00:16:48.120 || price to earnings ratio the p e ratio
00:16:49.189 || 00:16:49.199 || and so
00:16:51.530 || 00:16:51.540 || it wouldn't surprise me if you know like
00:16:53.389 || 00:16:53.399 || gold and silver you know that the s p
00:16:56.090 || 00:16:56.100 || just kind of continues to go sideways uh
00:16:57.650 || 00:16:57.660 || through the first half of this year but
00:17:00.650 || 00:17:00.660 || history is replete with examples of of
00:17:03.590 || 00:17:03.600 || uh of uh equities going you know crazy
00:17:06.230 || 00:17:06.240 || higher in countries that have uh where
00:17:07.610 || 00:17:07.620 || they're printing money
00:17:09.409 || 00:17:09.419 || and all the way back to you know to the
00:17:12.230 || 00:17:12.240 || Weimar Germany so
00:17:13.909 || 00:17:13.919 || um stock market is one of the only games
00:17:15.710 || 00:17:15.720 || in town when all this money gets printed
00:17:17.870 || 00:17:17.880 || again will probably benefit once more
00:17:19.309 || 00:17:19.319 || now do you see precious metals
00:17:20.870 || 00:17:20.880 || benefiting more because sometimes you
00:17:22.490 || 00:17:22.500 || can kind of have a silent crash in the
00:17:24.590 || 00:17:24.600 || stock market if you see high inflation
00:17:26.390 || 00:17:26.400 || in just the stock market going sideways
00:17:28.730 || 00:17:28.740 || are not really keeping up with inflation
00:17:31.250 || 00:17:31.260 || here will be a thing to watch
00:17:33.789 || 00:17:33.799 || um Elijah I think
00:17:35.930 || 00:17:35.940 || with all honesty we can you know if
00:17:37.190 || 00:17:37.200 || you're going to be objective about this
00:17:41.210 || 00:17:41.220 || we can all look back at 2020 and 2021
00:17:44.150 || 00:17:44.160 || and you know there's a kind of a limited
00:17:45.710 || 00:17:45.720 || amount of
00:17:47.870 || 00:17:47.880 || alternative Investments
00:17:50.990 || 00:17:51.000 || outside of the dollar-based system where
00:17:53.029 || 00:17:53.039 || money flows
00:17:54.470 || 00:17:54.480 || um it used to just be gold and silver
00:17:56.330 || 00:17:56.340 || and the gold miners right then Along
00:17:59.630 || 00:17:59.640 || Came Bitcoin and that siphoned off
00:18:03.110 || 00:18:03.120 || some of that cash you know in demand and
00:18:04.549 || 00:18:04.559 || then here came this you know
00:18:06.950 || 00:18:06.960 || multi-trillion dollar Ponzi scheme stuff
00:18:10.250 || 00:18:10.260 || of all these you know cryptocurrencies
00:18:13.310 || 00:18:13.320 || and you know a lot of the speculative
00:18:15.650 || 00:18:15.660 || money uh or money that just wanted
00:18:18.409 || 00:18:18.419 || something outside of the Fiat system got
00:18:20.690 || 00:18:20.700 || siphoned off into that as well but I
00:18:22.970 || 00:18:22.980 || don't know if the damage has been done I
00:18:24.289 || 00:18:24.299 || don't think that stuff's ever coming
00:18:26.390 || 00:18:26.400 || back I mean the scams of the yield
00:18:28.310 || 00:18:28.320 || harvesting you know and the all that
00:18:29.270 || 00:18:29.280 || stuff
00:18:31.669 || 00:18:31.679 || I don't think that's coming back so as
00:18:34.370 || 00:18:34.380 || this all turns again upside and investor
00:18:35.810 || 00:18:35.820 || interest Speculator interest all this
00:18:39.230 || 00:18:39.240 || kind of stuff gets focused again you
00:18:40.669 || 00:18:40.679 || know on allocating even just a couple
00:18:44.150 || 00:18:44.160 || percent outside of the Fiat system
00:18:46.130 || 00:18:46.140 || um bitcoin's gonna rush to catch up to
00:18:47.450 || 00:18:47.460 || you know what it should have gotten to
00:18:50.510 || 00:18:50.520 || last time and gold is like well we might
00:18:51.590 || 00:18:51.600 || as well watch some gold too I'm not
00:18:52.789 || 00:18:52.799 || gonna you know buy one of these other
00:18:54.770 || 00:18:54.780 || deals uh crypto or something like that
00:18:56.210 || 00:18:56.220 || gold and silver and the miners are
00:18:57.409 || 00:18:57.419 || benefited too and you know what one
00:18:58.430 || 00:18:58.440 || other thing I want to point out to
00:18:59.450 || 00:18:59.460 || people that
00:19:02.150 || 00:19:02.160 || uh I think it's really interesting
00:19:05.090 || 00:19:05.100 || as we record this on Friday uh the GDX
00:19:06.830 || 00:19:06.840 || is up again today
00:19:08.930 || 00:19:08.940 || and it's going to be its fourth green
00:19:10.970 || 00:19:10.980 || candle in a row to start the year and
00:19:13.490 || 00:19:13.500 || it's uh now up on the year just the four
00:19:17.870 || 00:19:17.880 || days this year more than 10 year to date
00:19:19.250 || 00:19:19.260 || okay and that's with silver kind of
00:19:21.590 || 00:19:21.600 || sideways and like I said gold up 30 or
00:19:22.850 || 00:19:22.860 || 40 dollars
00:19:25.789 || 00:19:25.799 || that intrigues me as well I mean that to
00:19:27.529 || 00:19:27.539 || get that kind of move and again we're
00:19:29.390 || 00:19:29.400 || already up from 22 or something like
00:19:31.549 || 00:19:31.559 || that two months ago to get that kind of
00:19:32.630 || 00:19:32.640 || move the first four days of the year
00:19:35.630 || 00:19:35.640 || that to me smells of hedge fund and
00:19:37.250 || 00:19:37.260 || institutional Money Getting allocated to
00:19:39.470 || 00:19:39.480 || the sector again for the first time in a
00:19:41.750 || 00:19:41.760 || year or two so watch watch the shares
00:19:44.270 || 00:19:44.280 || too I know another bullish factor for
00:19:46.070 || 00:19:46.080 || precious metals could be China's
00:19:47.990 || 00:19:48.000 || reopening uh because silver is a very
00:19:49.610 || 00:19:49.620 || much industrial metal
00:19:51.169 || 00:19:51.179 || um what impact do you think that will
00:19:53.210 || 00:19:53.220 || have on the medals well that's one of
00:19:54.529 || 00:19:54.539 || the things we missed out on and we're
00:19:56.090 || 00:19:56.100 || wrong about last year
00:19:58.190 || 00:19:58.200 || um in my forecast last year that I
00:19:59.750 || 00:19:59.760 || printed last January one of the bullish
00:20:01.250 || 00:20:01.260 || factors what we call the Chinese credit
00:20:02.390 || 00:20:02.400 || impulse
00:20:05.029 || 00:20:05.039 || and when that is rising and they're
00:20:06.230 || 00:20:06.240 || printing money and they're buying stuff
00:20:08.090 || 00:20:08.100 || with their printed money uh it was
00:20:09.830 || 00:20:09.840 || projected to rise last year because
00:20:11.930 || 00:20:11.940 || everybody thought well you know oh we're
00:20:13.669 || 00:20:13.679 || now to Omicron omicron's you know not
00:20:16.430 || 00:20:16.440 || that bad China will be reopening and
00:20:18.169 || 00:20:18.179 || their demand for everything is going to
00:20:20.570 || 00:20:20.580 || soar again and as we know now I mean
00:20:22.909 || 00:20:22.919 || they didn't really start to reopen their
00:20:25.549 || 00:20:25.559 || economy until you had this massive push
00:20:28.010 || 00:20:28.020 || of civil unrest in the fall and then
00:20:31.549 || 00:20:31.559 || finally by late December they finally
00:20:32.630 || 00:20:32.640 || you know they're moving in that
00:20:34.970 || 00:20:34.980 || direction and we'll see you know if that
00:20:37.130 || 00:20:37.140 || probably will continue so as that
00:20:38.930 || 00:20:38.940 || continues uh you know there's going to
00:20:41.270 || 00:20:41.280 || be a rush to play catch-up right and
00:20:43.850 || 00:20:43.860 || again a rush by the Chinese to move out
00:20:46.549 || 00:20:46.559 || of dollars you know and and spend it on
00:20:48.049 || 00:20:48.059 || their defense spending and spend it on
00:20:49.010 || 00:20:49.020 || infrastructure and all that kind of
00:20:52.010 || 00:20:52.020 || stuff well we're already
00:20:53.810 || 00:20:53.820 || um at a period now over the last 10
00:20:54.669 || 00:20:54.679 || years
00:20:57.230 || 00:20:57.240 || industrial metal stockpiles around the
00:21:01.010 || 00:21:01.020 || globe if you add up New York and London
00:21:03.169 || 00:21:03.179 || and Shanghai and every place else where
00:21:05.390 || 00:21:05.400 || it's stored Industrial Metal Supply
00:21:08.690 || 00:21:08.700 || copper zinc lead nickel aluminum they've
00:21:10.010 || 00:21:10.020 || all been dwindling
00:21:12.590 || 00:21:12.600 || I've got a chart in my uh annual
00:21:14.510 || 00:21:14.520 || forecast it just shows you this dramatic
00:21:16.490 || 00:21:16.500 || Trend well if all of a sudden China
00:21:18.230 || 00:21:18.240 || comes back full bore
00:21:20.690 || 00:21:20.700 || you know and part of that demand is not
00:21:22.250 || 00:21:22.260 || only Industrial Metals but silver you
00:21:24.110 || 00:21:24.120 || know solar panels and batteries and the
00:21:25.370 || 00:21:25.380 || rest
00:21:26.810 || 00:21:26.820 || where's the metal going to come from
00:21:28.310 || 00:21:28.320 || that you know the silver Institute put
00:21:29.870 || 00:21:29.880 || out that report I mean not many silver
00:21:31.370 || 00:21:31.380 || Institute you know this mainstream
00:21:33.590 || 00:21:33.600 || organization put out that report in
00:21:36.230 || 00:21:36.240 || November saying we're running about 150
00:21:38.810 || 00:21:38.820 || maybe even 200 million dollar 200
00:21:40.669 || 00:21:40.679 || million ounce I should say Supply
00:21:42.409 || 00:21:42.419 || deficit
00:21:44.210 || 00:21:44.220 || okay well
00:21:46.190 || 00:21:46.200 || what happens if China reopens you know
00:21:47.990 || 00:21:48.000 || in India and you know all these other
00:21:49.850 || 00:21:49.860 || countries Go full bore
00:21:51.289 || 00:21:51.299 || buying metal
00:21:51.950 || 00:21:51.960 || um
00:21:55.310 || 00:21:55.320 || and the dollar Falls at the same time
00:21:58.549 || 00:21:58.559 || um all of those pieces combined into
00:22:01.909 || 00:22:01.919 || again this year like 2010 and 19 next
00:22:05.149 || 00:22:05.159 || year like 2011 and 2020. wrapping this
00:22:06.890 || 00:22:06.900 || up it sounds like again you're looking
00:22:08.810 || 00:22:08.820 || for the first half of this year not too
00:22:10.310 || 00:22:10.320 || exciting the metals Market but the
00:22:12.409 || 00:22:12.419 || second half and next year to be quite
00:22:13.630 || 00:22:13.640 || exciting we can't give into
00:22:16.010 || 00:22:16.020 || individualized investment advice but
00:22:17.930 || 00:22:17.940 || some principles that people should be
00:22:19.669 || 00:22:19.679 || thinking about right now when it comes
00:22:21.590 || 00:22:21.600 || to investing in the metals
00:22:25.130 || 00:22:25.140 || well first and foremost and I I every
00:22:27.110 || 00:22:27.120 || time I say this and I've said this
00:22:28.789 || 00:22:28.799 || couple times already this week and I
00:22:30.289 || 00:22:30.299 || almost put it in the report but every
00:22:31.789 || 00:22:31.799 || time I say this I figure people are
00:22:33.950 || 00:22:33.960 || going to go I've been patient for 12
00:22:37.669 || 00:22:37.679 || years now and the patience is the key
00:22:39.350 || 00:22:39.360 || um because it's going to be choppy we've
00:22:41.510 || 00:22:41.520 || seen choppy already this week right I
00:22:42.649 || 00:22:42.659 || mean silver goes up and then all of a
00:22:44.149 || 00:22:44.159 || sudden the dollar goes up on Thursday
00:22:46.070 || 00:22:46.080 || and silver goes down 60 cents goes down
00:22:48.350 || 00:22:48.360 || you know four percent intraday
00:22:50.149 || 00:22:50.159 || it's gonna be choppy it's going to try
00:22:51.470 || 00:22:51.480 || to Buck you off
00:22:54.430 || 00:22:54.440 || okay and there's gonna be a trading
00:22:56.870 || 00:22:56.880 || sites and stuff out there that say oh
00:22:58.490 || 00:22:58.500 || yeah now you know Silver's gonna go down
00:23:00.110 || 00:23:00.120 || to this that and the other thing
00:23:03.610 || 00:23:03.620 || the key is going to be trusting yourself
00:23:06.529 || 00:23:06.539 || understanding following the macro data
00:23:08.090 || 00:23:08.100 || not just you know the technical data
00:23:10.730 || 00:23:10.740 || follow the macro data understand where
00:23:12.110 || 00:23:12.120 || this is headed that the FED ultimately
00:23:14.149 || 00:23:14.159 || you know is going to be caught having
00:23:15.710 || 00:23:15.720 || over tightened and driven the U.S
00:23:16.850 || 00:23:16.860 || economy of the ditch and then all of a
00:23:18.049 || 00:23:18.059 || sudden they're going to panic and go the
00:23:19.850 || 00:23:19.860 || other way just like they panicked in
00:23:22.490 || 00:23:22.500 || 2022 with 75 basis points what three or
00:23:24.890 || 00:23:24.900 || four times three times in a row
00:23:27.710 || 00:23:27.720 || and so you just gotta stay sharp and not
00:23:29.570 || 00:23:29.580 || let it get not let yourself get thrown
00:23:31.310 || 00:23:31.320 || off by what will probably be pretty
00:23:34.250 || 00:23:34.260 || choppy you know the first three four you
00:23:37.070 || 00:23:37.080 || know maybe five months of the year and
00:23:38.750 || 00:23:38.760 || um you know it's not as simple as just
00:23:40.250 || 00:23:40.260 || you know bud of the dip
00:23:42.529 || 00:23:42.539 || but maybe a dollar cost average you know
00:23:45.470 || 00:23:45.480 || maybe now is the time to you know
00:23:46.970 || 00:23:46.980 || um set up a you know one of these online
00:23:48.590 || 00:23:48.600 || accounts a couple my advertisers have
00:23:50.510 || 00:23:50.520 || good online accounts you know where you
00:23:52.490 || 00:23:52.500 || can access near spot you know maybe now
00:23:54.529 || 00:23:54.539 || is the time where you uh I don't know
00:23:55.970 || 00:23:55.980 || miles Franklin have a thing where they
00:23:57.169 || 00:23:57.179 || can take a little money out of you you
00:23:58.250 || 00:23:58.260 || know you can give a little money every
00:24:00.169 || 00:24:00.179 || couple of weeks sort of thing and buy
00:24:02.330 || 00:24:02.340 || whatever how many ounces you can get you
00:24:04.789 || 00:24:04.799 || know and just not be so concerned about
00:24:07.310 || 00:24:07.320 || uh the timing of your purchases just
00:24:10.210 || 00:24:10.220 || keep buying and accumulating because
00:24:13.010 || 00:24:13.020 || again history shows us that when this
00:24:14.870 || 00:24:14.880 || trend change when people figure it out
00:24:16.610 || 00:24:16.620 || that's when things take off and now that
00:24:19.310 || 00:24:19.320 || we'll have removed that siphon of of
00:24:21.490 || 00:24:21.500 || dollars going into you know these
00:24:24.289 || 00:24:24.299 || cryptocurrency scams
00:24:26.330 || 00:24:26.340 || um will probably go up and farther than
00:24:29.750 || 00:24:29.760 || people expect and then one last thing uh
00:24:31.850 || 00:24:31.860 || you know Elijah that that I've been
00:24:33.110 || 00:24:33.120 || waiting for
00:24:35.570 || 00:24:35.580 || maybe it'll happen this time you know
00:24:38.510 || 00:24:38.520 || once again in 2022 everybody bought what
00:24:40.010 || 00:24:40.020 || the Fed was selling
00:24:42.409 || 00:24:42.419 || you know they bought it in 2010 they
00:24:45.049 || 00:24:45.059 || bought it from 14 to 18. you know that
00:24:46.730 || 00:24:46.740 || oh yes we're going to normalize the
00:24:48.610 || 00:24:48.620 || balance sheet you know and
00:24:52.909 || 00:24:52.919 || no they're not okay they're not
00:24:56.029 || 00:24:56.039 || everything changed in March of 2009 and
00:24:58.730 || 00:24:58.740 || the next QE program will be even larger
00:25:00.230 || 00:25:00.240 || than the last that's what the trend is
00:25:02.510 || 00:25:02.520 || and one of these times
00:25:04.130 || 00:25:04.140 || everybody invest in gold and silver is
00:25:05.870 || 00:25:05.880 || going to figure that out
00:25:08.090 || 00:25:08.100 || and instead of having the GDX go from
00:25:12.169 || 00:25:12.179 || you know from uh 15 to 45 and then back
00:25:14.630 || 00:25:14.640 || to 25 it's going to go from 15 to 45
00:25:16.490 || 00:25:16.500 || maybe pause and everyone's going to go
00:25:18.049 || 00:25:18.059 || okay and then it's going to keep on
00:25:19.130 || 00:25:19.140 || going
00:25:22.850 || 00:25:22.860 || and so patience and trusting yourself
00:25:24.830 || 00:25:24.840 || and watching the macro
00:25:26.630 || 00:25:26.640 || is going to be the key
00:25:28.250 || 00:25:28.260 || um and then again that's when we started
00:25:30.049 || 00:25:30.059 || off talking about the importance of my
