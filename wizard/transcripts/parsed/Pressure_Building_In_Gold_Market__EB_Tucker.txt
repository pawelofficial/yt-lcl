00:00:02.930 || 00:00:02.940 || the New York Futures Market
00:00:05.269 || 00:00:05.279 || keeps the price pegged somewhere okay
00:00:09.049 || 00:00:09.059 || but the actual production gold is
00:00:11.509 || 00:00:11.519 || struggling to grow you know that's your

00:01:48.830 || 00:01:48.840 || too I did want to discuss you know 2023
00:01:51.289 || 00:01:51.299 || what you're expecting for the gold and
00:01:52.670 || 00:01:52.680 || silver markets
00:01:54.710 || 00:01:54.720 || um I know that you've said that I mean
00:01:56.749 || 00:01:56.759 || typically the first six weeks of the
00:01:59.210 || 00:01:59.220 || year are very bullish for gold
00:02:00.770 || 00:02:00.780 || um and that's what we're seeing on this
00:02:02.929 || 00:02:02.939 || first trading day here uh precious
00:02:05.450 || 00:02:05.460 || metals up but your perspective on what
00:02:07.850 || 00:02:07.860 || we're gonna see uh starting off this
00:02:08.690 || 00:02:08.700 || year
00:02:12.830 || 00:02:12.840 || yeah so I I I just I I constantly feel
00:02:15.110 || 00:02:15.120 || like I'm I'm living in some sort of
00:02:18.410 || 00:02:18.420 || world where I'm the only person that
00:02:20.510 || 00:02:20.520 || that sees something and everybody else
00:02:22.369 || 00:02:22.379 || I'm not sure what they're looking at but
00:02:24.530 || 00:02:24.540 || I do a lot of things and I tell people
00:02:26.990 || 00:02:27.000 || what I do and I don't think they they
00:02:28.850 || 00:02:28.860 || really listen or they'll do them one of
00:02:30.770 || 00:02:30.780 || the things I do is I really sit down
00:02:33.110 || 00:02:33.120 || first day of the year and set written
00:02:35.869 || 00:02:35.879 || goals for the year and um I've done this
00:02:38.930 || 00:02:38.940 || for about 20 years now and I was telling
00:02:41.570 || 00:02:41.580 || someone over the Christmas break uh that
00:02:43.850 || 00:02:43.860 || that I have accomplished every goal that
00:02:45.589 || 00:02:45.599 || I've ever set I know that sounds crazy
00:02:47.930 || 00:02:47.940 || but I really it's really really true and
00:02:49.729 || 00:02:49.739 || some of the sometimes it took many years
00:02:52.190 || 00:02:52.200 || to do it and sometimes it takes a short
00:02:54.290 || 00:02:54.300 || amount of time but part of that process
00:02:56.509 || 00:02:56.519 || is taking assessment of what's where you
00:02:58.369 || 00:02:58.379 || are you know it's been one of the things
00:03:00.530 || 00:03:00.540 || I do on the money side of things I mean
00:03:02.030 || 00:03:02.040 || not all goals are money right if you
00:03:03.589 || 00:03:03.599 || have health goals and family and all
00:03:05.210 || 00:03:05.220 || it's very important to have all these
00:03:07.190 || 00:03:07.200 || goals for a balanced life but on the
00:03:08.630 || 00:03:08.640 || money side you really got to look at
00:03:11.449 || 00:03:11.459 || what's where you are like a snapshot
00:03:13.670 || 00:03:13.680 || and so one of the things I did was I I
00:03:16.850 || 00:03:16.860 || looked at 2022 because I feel like
00:03:19.729 || 00:03:19.739 || people are very confused and I feel like
00:03:21.890 || 00:03:21.900 || it was a year of confusion the gold was
00:03:23.869 || 00:03:23.879 || one of the best assets of the year it
00:03:26.290 || 00:03:26.300 || was up 0.5
00:03:29.330 || 00:03:29.340 || think about that 0.5 percent that's how
00:03:30.770 || 00:03:30.780 || much gold was up it was one of the best
00:03:33.229 || 00:03:33.239 || assets silver was up almost four percent
00:03:36.589 || 00:03:36.599 || and oil was up maybe four percent in the
00:03:37.490 || 00:03:37.500 || U.S
00:03:40.250 || 00:03:40.260 || uh but bonds long-term Bonds were down
00:03:43.729 || 00:03:43.739 || 32 percent and and NASDAQ was down 32
00:03:46.550 || 00:03:46.560 || percent and s p was down almost 20 and
00:03:49.070 || 00:03:49.080 || and this is a really crazy year right I
00:03:53.390 || 00:03:53.400 || mean Bitcoin was down 65 and still when
00:03:55.130 || 00:03:55.140 || people talk to me that they're saying
00:03:57.649 || 00:03:57.659 || what should I do about my pancake coin
00:04:00.050 || 00:04:00.060 || or whatever the coin is should I buy
00:04:00.830 || 00:04:00.840 || more
00:04:04.070 || 00:04:04.080 || I'm thinking to myself probably yes you
00:04:05.630 || 00:04:05.640 || probably should buy more because I don't
00:04:07.910 || 00:04:07.920 || think I don't think even zero is going
00:04:09.410 || 00:04:09.420 || to be a price that's going to discourage
00:04:10.850 || 00:04:10.860 || you so might as well you might as well
00:04:13.309 || 00:04:13.319 || write it all the way to zero but okay so
00:04:15.410 || 00:04:15.420 || so I was taking this assessment I was
00:04:17.569 || 00:04:17.579 || thinking you know gold really did its
00:04:20.870 || 00:04:20.880 || job last year this was a time when um it
00:04:25.129 || 00:04:25.139 || was a bad time to speculate 2022 was was
00:04:26.570 || 00:04:26.580 || it was not a good time to be a secular
00:04:29.330 || 00:04:29.340 || and so gold did absolutely nothing and
00:04:31.430 || 00:04:31.440 || and for some reason that's something
00:04:35.810 || 00:04:35.820 || people are not happy with so uh I've I I
00:04:39.890 || 00:04:39.900 || feel like gold is so sensible as part of
00:04:43.270 || 00:04:43.280 || your asset base if you're wealthy I mean
00:04:45.890 || 00:04:45.900 || if you're speculating and if you're and
00:04:48.170 || 00:04:48.180 || if you're trying to to get started in
00:04:50.030 || 00:04:50.040 || life then you know I think something
00:04:52.249 || 00:04:52.259 || like a royalty company like Metallica is
00:04:54.650 || 00:04:54.660 || is how you really boost things if gold
00:04:56.870 || 00:04:56.880 || goes up you know then the royalty
00:04:58.610 || 00:04:58.620 || company should go up more right because
00:05:01.850 || 00:05:01.860 || it has exposure to Future production the
00:05:03.469 || 00:05:03.479 || gold is not really like that you know
00:05:05.930 || 00:05:05.940 || does it it doesn't it doesn't um
00:05:07.670 || 00:05:07.680 || shoot higher you're not going to like
00:05:10.010 || 00:05:10.020 || wake up tomorrow and goal it's like nine
00:05:11.210 || 00:05:11.220 || thousand dollars it's not going to
00:05:12.409 || 00:05:12.419 || happen and you're not going to be
00:05:14.390 || 00:05:14.400 || swapping it for loaves of bread it's
00:05:16.909 || 00:05:16.919 || kind of crazy to think that but but it's
00:05:19.790 || 00:05:19.800 || rock solid if you're already rich you
00:05:22.310 || 00:05:22.320 || don't this there's a rule Elijah there's
00:05:23.749 || 00:05:23.759 || a rule in life
00:05:26.150 || 00:05:26.160 || and the rule is is that you only have to
00:05:29.510 || 00:05:29.520 || get rich one time after you do that you
00:05:31.909 || 00:05:31.919 || have to stay Rich it's very hard for
00:05:33.830 || 00:05:33.840 || people it's really really hard and so
00:05:36.050 || 00:05:36.060 || gold last year if you were Rich you
00:05:38.450 || 00:05:38.460 || stayed rich but back to your first
00:05:40.310 || 00:05:40.320 || couple weeks of the year it's very
00:05:43.129 || 00:05:43.139 || important typically it comes out of a
00:05:45.170 || 00:05:45.180 || cannon you know the gold stocks at the
00:05:46.310 || 00:05:46.320 || gold price
00:05:49.070 || 00:05:49.080 || have a strong showing in the first half
00:05:51.409 || 00:05:51.419 || of the first quarter that runs through
00:05:53.570 || 00:05:53.580 || about Valentine's Day I don't actually
00:05:56.570 || 00:05:56.580 || know why this is the case uh I I think
00:05:59.810 || 00:05:59.820 || part of it is due to Chinese New Year
00:06:02.689 || 00:06:02.699 || type influences in the market I think
00:06:05.330 || 00:06:05.340 || part of it is due to recalibration of
00:06:07.490 || 00:06:07.500 || portfolios that happens first of the
00:06:10.310 || 00:06:10.320 || year I know for matala we'll talk to
00:06:13.129 || 00:06:13.139 || funds A lot of times and they they don't
00:06:14.930 || 00:06:14.940 || want to do something in December that's
00:06:17.390 || 00:06:17.400 || a time when everybody's taking tax
00:06:19.670 || 00:06:19.680 || losses and all these things so I think
00:06:21.050 || 00:06:21.060 || that has something to do with it as well
00:06:23.150 || 00:06:23.160 || I mean you can see these these stocks
00:06:25.129 || 00:06:25.139 || related to the gold business did not do
00:06:27.170 || 00:06:27.180 || very well in December and I think I
00:06:29.570 || 00:06:29.580 || think that for that's a part of it so I
00:06:31.010 || 00:06:31.020 || don't think we really need to know why I
00:06:32.990 || 00:06:33.000 || don't think it matters I think that um
00:06:34.850 || 00:06:34.860 || but if it's it's a time when you're
00:06:37.129 || 00:06:37.139 || positioned I think you're pretty pleased
00:06:38.930 || 00:06:38.940 || in the beginning of the year and it's
00:06:41.809 || 00:06:41.819 || shaping up that way now we can talk
00:06:44.570 || 00:06:44.580 || about that more if you'd like
00:06:46.670 || 00:06:46.680 || definitely I know last year we saw this
00:06:50.090 || 00:06:50.100 || uh and with the start of the Russia
00:06:53.330 || 00:06:53.340 || Ukraine war we also saw a gold pretty
00:06:56.210 || 00:06:56.220 || much hit uh the same Hyatt did back in
00:06:57.770 || 00:06:57.780 || 2020 so
00:06:59.870 || 00:06:59.880 || um do you anticipate gold making a new
00:07:03.290 || 00:07:03.300 || high this year above that 2070 2080
00:07:05.090 || 00:07:05.100 || level I know this is going to sound
00:07:07.249 || 00:07:07.259 || crazy but
00:07:11.570 || 00:07:11.580 || I believe that the gold price is uh the
00:07:13.790 || 00:07:13.800 || tail wax the dog what I mean by that is
00:07:14.749 || 00:07:14.759 || that
00:07:17.210 || 00:07:17.220 || the Futures Market determines the spot
00:07:20.570 || 00:07:20.580 || price and it's almost the equivalent of
00:07:23.150 || 00:07:23.160 || if you were a corn farmer and you're
00:07:25.790 || 00:07:25.800 || producing corn but someone in New York
00:07:28.969 || 00:07:28.979 || at the Mercantile Exchange is setting
00:07:31.909 || 00:07:31.919 || the price of corn based on the Futures
00:07:34.909 || 00:07:34.919 || Market meaning if the price of corn goes
00:07:37.850 || 00:07:37.860 || higher than than they want it to go then
00:07:40.670 || 00:07:40.680 || they can sell millions and millions of
00:07:42.650 || 00:07:42.660 || bushels of corn that are not actually
00:07:45.249 || 00:07:45.259 || corn all they all they are is future
00:07:48.050 || 00:07:48.060 || agreements to produce hypothetical corn
00:07:50.809 || 00:07:50.819 || and you do that with leverage and for
00:07:52.189 || 00:07:52.199 || instance in the gold market many times
00:07:54.469 || 00:07:54.479 || you can sell an ounce of gold on the
00:07:58.430 || 00:07:58.440 || Futures market for sixty dollars and you
00:07:59.930 || 00:07:59.940 || can do the same on the other side you
00:08:02.029 || 00:08:02.039 || can buy an ounce of gold for sixty
00:08:03.650 || 00:08:03.660 || dollars and that and people say wait a
00:08:05.029 || 00:08:05.039 || minute I want to buy an ounce of gold
00:08:06.890 || 00:08:06.900 || for sixty dollars but it's you're not
00:08:08.270 || 00:08:08.280 || actually getting an ounce of gold you're
00:08:10.730 || 00:08:10.740 || getting the future commitment for an
00:08:13.490 || 00:08:13.500 || ounce of gold from some unknown seller
00:08:15.770 || 00:08:15.780 || of that future commitment and and
00:08:17.689 || 00:08:17.699 || when the Ukraine thing happened last
00:08:19.730 || 00:08:19.740 || year gold shots of like 2080 or
00:08:22.189 || 00:08:22.199 || something like that 2083 I was watching
00:08:24.110 || 00:08:24.120 || that happen I remember I was up most of
00:08:25.790 || 00:08:25.800 || the night when that was happening
00:08:29.930 || 00:08:29.940 || it's about February and uh what we saw
00:08:32.630 || 00:08:32.640 || going on this is the stream here behind
00:08:35.269 || 00:08:35.279 || me this is all the major Metals what we
00:08:38.750 || 00:08:38.760 || saw going on was we saw 41 million
00:08:43.190 || 00:08:43.200 || ounces of gold in one session trade in
00:08:45.610 || 00:08:45.620 || the Futures market and that's
00:08:49.370 || 00:08:49.380 || approximately one year of gold
00:08:51.769 || 00:08:51.779 || production and so people say well how
00:08:54.110 || 00:08:54.120 || can you can't be serious that you know
00:08:55.790 || 00:08:55.800 || Newmont and Barrack are selling their
00:08:57.470 || 00:08:57.480 || entire no of course they're not doing
00:08:59.870 || 00:08:59.880 || that because I mean it you can't really
00:09:02.509 || 00:09:02.519 || do that and so what what I want people
00:09:05.750 || 00:09:05.760 || to understand is that um this is not a
00:09:08.509 || 00:09:08.519 || conspiracy okay I don't believe in
00:09:11.870 || 00:09:11.880 || conspiracies the what happens is and I
00:09:13.790 || 00:09:13.800 || watched this for 20 years now
00:09:16.790 || 00:09:16.800 || is that the price seems to be controlled
00:09:19.310 || 00:09:19.320 || by the Futures market and not by the
00:09:21.769 || 00:09:21.779 || spot Market meaning not by buyers and
00:09:24.590 || 00:09:24.600 || sellers not by producers and users okay
00:09:26.930 || 00:09:26.940 || uh it's controlled by the Futures market
00:09:29.630 || 00:09:29.640 || so that being said today I see the price
00:09:32.030 || 00:09:32.040 || at eighteen fifty that's where the price
00:09:36.590 || 00:09:36.600 || was last June and what I've noticed is
00:09:39.949 || 00:09:39.959 || that the price tends to go to a certain
00:09:42.530 || 00:09:42.540 || level and then trade around that level
00:09:46.310 || 00:09:46.320 || until the Futures Contract changes to
00:09:49.370 || 00:09:49.380 || the next date so my suspicion is maybe
00:09:53.030 || 00:09:53.040 || it's 1850 maybe it's 1875 you know that
00:09:54.530 || 00:09:54.540 || might be where we trade here for a
00:09:57.290 || 00:09:57.300 || little bit and then when that becomes
00:10:01.009 || 00:10:01.019 || hard to defend it goes to the next to
00:10:02.030 || 00:10:02.040 || the next
00:10:07.190 || 00:10:07.200 || area okay and so my guess is is that
00:10:09.650 || 00:10:09.660 || that is going to become increasingly
00:10:12.829 || 00:10:12.839 || hard to defend and and probably we go up
00:10:15.650 || 00:10:15.660 || into the 2000s this year I I think I
00:10:18.350 || 00:10:18.360 || think that the gold industry production
00:10:20.990 || 00:10:21.000 || side of the industry is struggling uh I
00:10:23.389 || 00:10:23.399 || of course as you know I'm I'm extremely
00:10:25.730 || 00:10:25.740 || connected to the royalty business there
00:10:28.630 || 00:10:28.640 || have been nine takeovers nine
00:10:31.509 || 00:10:31.519 || Acquisitions mergers or takeovers nine
00:10:35.509 || 00:10:35.519 || in the small royalty company sector
00:10:38.990 || 00:10:39.000 || now that's a frenzy if any other
00:10:41.389 || 00:10:41.399 || industry if you were talking about the
00:10:43.790 || 00:10:43.800 || car wash industry and you know the the
00:10:45.889 || 00:10:45.899 || bulk of the companies have been acquired
00:10:48.470 || 00:10:48.480 || that would be you know pick up Investors
00:10:50.030 || 00:10:50.040 || Business Daily and there'd be an article
00:10:51.829 || 00:10:51.839 || about it but in the gold business
00:10:54.889 || 00:10:54.899 || nobody's talking about it and so um I
00:10:56.750 || 00:10:56.760 || can tell you that same thing's happening
00:10:59.930 || 00:10:59.940 || in the major mining companies uh you
00:11:02.150 || 00:11:02.160 || know Barrack and newmot and igniko have
00:11:05.389 || 00:11:05.399 || been have been aggressive acquirers of
00:11:07.910 || 00:11:07.920 || of mid-tier companies
00:11:11.630 || 00:11:11.640 || there are not many left okay so what
00:11:13.910 || 00:11:13.920 || that tells you is that the the the
00:11:17.569 || 00:11:17.579 || production profile of the gold industry
00:11:19.610 || 00:11:19.620 || this is the guys that are blasting and
00:11:21.650 || 00:11:21.660 || digging and driving the truck out of the
00:11:23.509 || 00:11:23.519 || mine with the ore and all this stuff as
00:11:27.590 || 00:11:27.600 || you know uh these people are having an
00:11:30.410 || 00:11:30.420 || increasingly difficult time identifying
00:11:35.389 || 00:11:35.399 || large new feasible supplies of of gold
00:11:39.650 || 00:11:39.660 || and and so and so I I know if you're
00:11:42.050 || 00:11:42.060 || watching this and your your day job is
00:11:44.509 || 00:11:44.519 || that you're you know off to the to the
00:11:45.710 || 00:11:45.720 || factory or something
00:11:47.990 || 00:11:48.000 || don't be discouraged this is actually
00:11:50.509 || 00:11:50.519 || extremely simple so you have not
00:11:52.790 || 00:11:52.800 || invested for the companies have not
00:11:54.829 || 00:11:54.839 || invested for a long time in New gold
00:11:57.650 || 00:11:57.660 || mines and the gold mines have a finite
00:11:59.329 || 00:11:59.339 || Supply so you're running you're running
00:12:01.970 || 00:12:01.980 || short okay so what happens when you
00:12:04.310 || 00:12:04.320 || start having less you know of a product
00:12:07.069 || 00:12:07.079 || the price goes up that's the deal and so
00:12:09.710 || 00:12:09.720 || my my point is is that the New York
00:12:12.889 || 00:12:12.899 || Futures Market keeps the price pegged
00:12:15.530 || 00:12:15.540 || somewhere okay but the actual production
00:12:19.490 || 00:12:19.500 || of gold is struggling to grow so that
00:12:22.430 || 00:12:22.440 || those are your two that's your you know
00:12:24.889 || 00:12:24.899 || that's your Star Wars Battle Royale okay
00:12:27.710 || 00:12:27.720 || and and so I think this is this year
00:12:30.410 || 00:12:30.420 || you're going to see that pressure grow
00:12:33.410 || 00:12:33.420 || to the point where probably you need to
00:12:35.690 || 00:12:35.700 || have a new high-end gold I think it's
00:12:40.490 || 00:12:40.500 || it's a year we can see gold up 20 very
00:12:42.470 || 00:12:42.480 || easily and that would put it into a new
00:12:45.110 || 00:12:45.120 || high and it might overshoot from there A
00:12:46.970 || 00:12:46.980 || lot of times it goes a little too much
00:12:49.790 || 00:12:49.800 || and then it has to calm down but this is
00:12:51.889 || 00:12:51.899 || the year for that I really think this is
00:12:54.110 || 00:12:54.120 || the year for that and and um you look at
00:12:56.110 || 00:12:56.120 || the other assets
00:12:58.370 || 00:12:58.380 || you know the crypto we look at all the
00:12:59.150 || 00:12:59.160 || stuff
00:13:01.730 || 00:13:01.740 || and what you see is that it it did a
00:13:04.009 || 00:13:04.019 || gold did great last year and and if
00:13:07.910 || 00:13:07.920 || you're if you're wealthy great is even
00:13:10.550 || 00:13:10.560 || when Tech investors and all these people
00:13:14.269 || 00:13:14.279 || were seeing 33 declines in the NASDAQ
00:13:16.910 || 00:13:16.920 || index I mean that's not an individual
00:13:20.389 || 00:13:20.399 || stock that's the index so imagine if you
00:13:23.870 || 00:13:23.880 || just have a 401k and you're in the tech
00:13:25.910 || 00:13:25.920 || stocks highly aggressive I mean you're
00:13:27.350 || 00:13:27.360 || down you started with a million bucks
00:13:31.670 || 00:13:31.680 || you got six 600 to 60 000 left that's a
00:13:33.889 || 00:13:33.899 || stinger it definitely is a stinger there
00:13:35.870 || 00:13:35.880 || and the fact that gold just was pretty
00:13:38.090 || 00:13:38.100 || much flat as you mentioned that that's
00:13:40.310 || 00:13:40.320 || good uh for last year
00:13:42.769 || 00:13:42.779 || um now this coming year as if we do see
00:13:45.230 || 00:13:45.240 || gold make new all-time highs
00:13:47.030 || 00:13:47.040 || um silver I know you know is far from
00:13:49.430 || 00:13:49.440 || its all-time high but half of its
00:13:50.930 || 00:13:50.940 || all-time high right now
00:13:52.550 || 00:13:52.560 || um do you anticipate new highs for
00:13:54.490 || 00:13:54.500 || silver or do you anticipate silver
00:13:57.710 || 00:13:57.720 || outperforming gold uh in this year yeah
00:14:00.530 || 00:14:00.540 || did it last year I mean it was up four
00:14:02.389 || 00:14:02.399 || percent which I know these sound like
00:14:04.490 || 00:14:04.500 || really small numbers but but it was up
00:14:07.009 || 00:14:07.019 || four percent to Gold's half a percent
00:14:10.370 || 00:14:10.380 || so silver has has strange economics I
00:14:12.889 || 00:14:12.899 || mean in one sense it's it's a mostly a
00:14:14.810 || 00:14:14.820 || byproduct metal and what that means
00:14:17.269 || 00:14:17.279 || people not familiar is that is that
00:14:19.129 || 00:14:19.139 || you're mining for something else like
00:14:21.710 || 00:14:21.720 || lead or zinc or some other metal and you
00:14:24.050 || 00:14:24.060 || get some silver that's that's how most
00:14:26.690 || 00:14:26.700 || of the silver enters the world
00:14:30.590 || 00:14:30.600 || um 24 an ounce is a is a unbelievably
00:14:32.150 || 00:14:32.160 || low price
00:14:34.610 || 00:14:34.620 || for silver I mean it's it's if you don't
00:14:36.410 || 00:14:36.420 || have a silver coin like if you're if
00:14:39.530 || 00:14:39.540 || you're just learning about silver go buy
00:14:41.689 || 00:14:41.699 || a silver coin and just you know just
00:14:44.030 || 00:14:44.040 || play with it I mean give it to your kid
00:14:46.129 || 00:14:46.139 || to fly I got silver coins all over the
00:14:48.470 || 00:14:48.480 || place I mean my my kids are banging them
00:14:50.150 || 00:14:50.160 || around with each other they're losing I
00:14:53.210 || 00:14:53.220 || must have lost 100 silver coins and and
00:14:55.970 || 00:14:55.980 || the reason why I don't care about that
00:14:58.970 || 00:14:58.980 || is because it's really your first
00:15:00.590 || 00:15:00.600 || introduction to play with the silver
00:15:03.230 || 00:15:03.240 || coin to bang it together it's amazing
00:15:06.530 || 00:15:06.540 || right I mean it's an amazing metal and
00:15:09.889 || 00:15:09.899 || to think that it's 24 an ounce is crazy
00:15:12.470 || 00:15:12.480 || I mean if you try to get a physical
00:15:14.509 || 00:15:14.519 || ounce like a an eagle I mean the
00:15:16.430 || 00:15:16.440 || premiums have come down a little bit but
00:15:19.250 || 00:15:19.260 || I mean if you were paying close to forty
00:15:22.009 || 00:15:22.019 || dollars in around the election time you
00:15:23.689 || 00:15:23.699 || were paying close to forty dollars for a
00:15:25.550 || 00:15:25.560 || silver eagle that is wild right I mean
00:15:28.790 || 00:15:28.800 || so the price is 24 but if you want one
00:15:30.650 || 00:15:30.660 || it's forty dollars I mean does that give
00:15:32.170 || 00:15:32.180 || you some idea of
00:15:35.090 || 00:15:35.100 || it's just it's just I think if people
00:15:37.189 || 00:15:37.199 || slow down and think about the world we
00:15:39.769 || 00:15:39.779 || live in I bought uh I have several cars
00:15:42.170 || 00:15:42.180 || I bought a car last year
00:15:44.750 || 00:15:44.760 || and uh it was a car that I kind of
00:15:46.370 || 00:15:46.380 || wanted for a while so my friend was like
00:15:47.750 || 00:15:47.760 || you should get the car you know it's you
00:15:50.210 || 00:15:50.220 || know it makes it's not crazy so anyway
00:15:52.490 || 00:15:52.500 || so once you get the car and I paid
00:15:55.790 || 00:15:55.800 || um MSRP full MSRP
00:15:56.930 || 00:15:56.940 || Plus
00:15:59.629 || 00:15:59.639 || a fee and people might have heard about
00:16:01.610 || 00:16:01.620 || this but anyway the guy was explaining
00:16:04.310 || 00:16:04.320 || to me that if I want the car I have to
00:16:06.650 || 00:16:06.660 || pay the full sticker I mean never in my
00:16:08.269 || 00:16:08.279 || life if I paid the sticker you know
00:16:10.069 || 00:16:10.079 || normally it's like the sticker says like
00:16:13.250 || 00:16:13.260 || 120 Grand or something you pay like 105
00:16:14.810 || 00:16:14.820 || or whatever you're out the door but
00:16:16.370 || 00:16:16.380 || anyway but nowadays it's like you pay
00:16:18.470 || 00:16:18.480 || the full sticker price and then you pay
00:16:21.590 || 00:16:21.600 || a fee on top of it to get the car so
00:16:23.750 || 00:16:23.760 || and you know what's funny about this is
00:16:25.850 || 00:16:25.860 || that is that that means there's no
00:16:28.970 || 00:16:28.980 || inflation because technically speaking
00:16:31.790 || 00:16:31.800 || you paid the sticker price and the extra
00:16:33.710 || 00:16:33.720 || fee was only a fee so there is no
00:16:35.569 || 00:16:35.579 || inflation the price didn't go up it's
00:16:37.370 || 00:16:37.380 || the same price as last year or maybe the
00:16:39.110 || 00:16:39.120 || sticker went up two percent
00:16:41.150 || 00:16:41.160 || so this is the world we live in right
00:16:42.769 || 00:16:42.779 || now I think people have got to
00:16:44.689 || 00:16:44.699 || understand this is the world that we
00:16:47.569 || 00:16:47.579 || live in so go buy a silver coin it's
00:16:49.550 || 00:16:49.560 || twenty four dollars and if you want it
00:16:53.629 || 00:16:53.639 || it's 40. so like the reason there's many
00:16:55.490 || 00:16:55.500 || reasons to do this you know one because
00:16:57.769 || 00:16:57.779 || it's fun just something you can do with
00:17:00.110 || 00:17:00.120 || your kids that doesn't involve an iPad I
00:17:02.329 || 00:17:02.339 || mean that's that's one of the number one
00:17:05.270 || 00:17:05.280 || reasons you could do it and uh number
00:17:07.909 || 00:17:07.919 || two is is that it's great insight into
00:17:09.770 || 00:17:09.780 || what's going on in the world right now I
00:17:12.110 || 00:17:12.120 || mean this is the world we live in this
00:17:14.390 || 00:17:14.400 || is a centrally planned economic system
00:17:16.189 || 00:17:16.199 || this is not a free market if it was a
00:17:18.770 || 00:17:18.780 || free market the price would be 40 and if
00:17:20.750 || 00:17:20.760 || you wanted it the price will be 40 plus
00:17:22.909 || 00:17:22.919 || maybe a dollar to you know put it in a
00:17:24.650 || 00:17:24.660 || case or something like that it wouldn't
00:17:29.150 || 00:17:29.160 || be it wouldn't be a 80 premium you know
00:17:31.310 || 00:17:31.320 || to to actually get something in your
00:17:33.530 || 00:17:33.540 || hand because that that means that the
00:17:36.049 || 00:17:36.059 || actual price is not the real price I
00:17:38.270 || 00:17:38.280 || hope that makes sense to people but just
00:17:40.909 || 00:17:40.919 || strolling down to the the local jewelry
00:17:43.010 || 00:17:43.020 || and coin or whatever and picking up a
00:17:46.370 || 00:17:46.380 || silver coin can really be I think a
00:17:47.870 || 00:17:47.880 || worthwhile activity right now and
00:17:49.909 || 00:17:49.919 || helping gain some insight into the
00:17:51.230 || 00:17:51.240 || system that we're in
00:17:53.150 || 00:17:53.160 || what I think is very interesting is we
00:17:55.490 || 00:17:55.500 || are seeing an Awakening right now people
00:17:59.390 || 00:17:59.400 || are some people are kind of growing to
00:18:02.150 || 00:18:02.160 || understand what precious metals are and
00:18:04.010 || 00:18:04.020 || especially the wealthy right now and
00:18:06.350 || 00:18:06.360 || Nations across the world are
00:18:08.810 || 00:18:08.820 || accumulating precious metals and I did
00:18:11.270 || 00:18:11.280 || want to ask you about that we are seeing
00:18:13.970 || 00:18:13.980 || the brics Nations for example developing
00:18:15.710 || 00:18:15.720 || a new Reserve currency some people think
00:18:17.450 || 00:18:17.460 || it's going to be gold-backed we're
00:18:19.370 || 00:18:19.380 || seeing other countries moving to Gold
00:18:22.190 || 00:18:22.200 || what is your perspective on that I know
00:18:24.529 || 00:18:24.539 || we we are starting to see a multi-polar
00:18:26.210 || 00:18:26.220 || world which is what you've talked about
00:18:28.490 || 00:18:28.500 || before it's interesting you bring you
00:18:31.370 || 00:18:31.380 || bring that up that's that's a huge point
00:18:34.549 || 00:18:34.559 || a huge point I'd encourage everyone okay
00:18:37.250 || 00:18:37.260 || on YouTube Somebody put up a video of me
00:18:41.630 || 00:18:41.640 || giving a speech in London in 2019 at a
00:18:42.590 || 00:18:42.600 || conference
00:18:46.070 || 00:18:46.080 || in my my speech I got to tell you I I
00:18:48.950 || 00:18:48.960 || was sent to this conference by Metallo
00:18:51.710 || 00:18:51.720 || royalty and I got there and they they
00:18:53.390 || 00:18:53.400 || took me to dinner to put the people that
00:18:54.650 || 00:18:54.660 || put the conference on and they were like
00:18:55.789 || 00:18:55.799 || so what are you gonna do for your
00:18:57.350 || 00:18:57.360 || keynote address tomorrow I said keynote
00:18:58.370 || 00:18:58.380 || address they're like yeah you're the
00:19:00.590 || 00:19:00.600 || keynote speaker I had no idea so I had
00:19:02.330 || 00:19:02.340 || to go back to the room and I got on the
00:19:04.370 || 00:19:04.380 || phone with one of my favorite people in
00:19:07.070 || 00:19:07.080 || the world to consiglieri type guy of
00:19:10.190 || 00:19:10.200 || sorts very smart little curmudgeon guy
00:19:12.110 || 00:19:12.120 || that that really sees the world
00:19:13.789 || 00:19:13.799 || accurately have all these people to talk
00:19:17.390 || 00:19:17.400 || to and we talked for hours and and we
00:19:19.669 || 00:19:19.679 || talked about this is 2019 so this is
00:19:22.669 || 00:19:22.679 || before remember 2019 if you had to walk
00:19:24.110 || 00:19:24.120 || around with a mask on people thought you
00:19:26.270 || 00:19:26.280 || were crazy it's before the pandemic all
00:19:30.470 || 00:19:30.480 || the stuff so so we we decided in our
00:19:32.150 || 00:19:32.160 || conversation that we felt like
00:19:34.490 || 00:19:34.500 || globalization was ending
00:19:36.470 || 00:19:36.480 || and the world was going to split off
00:19:39.350 || 00:19:39.360 || into zones and it's really fascinating
00:19:41.750 || 00:19:41.760 || if you find this speech that I gave it's
00:19:43.250 || 00:19:43.260 || time stamped and you know it was
00:19:46.430 || 00:19:46.440 || uploaded then whatever my whole speeches
00:19:47.870 || 00:19:47.880 || is because it was all about where you
00:19:49.549 || 00:19:49.559 || invest it was like you you can't make an
00:19:51.350 || 00:19:51.360 || investment decision without considering
00:19:53.810 || 00:19:53.820 || that the world is going to fracture into
00:19:56.690 || 00:19:56.700 || zones and you have to make sure that
00:20:00.049 || 00:20:00.059 || your investment is in a Zone where your
00:20:03.470 || 00:20:03.480 || Society will have influence meaning if
00:20:05.450 || 00:20:05.460 || you're splitting into a Zone over here
00:20:07.250 || 00:20:07.260 || but you live over here it's going to be
00:20:08.930 || 00:20:08.940 || very hard for you to make money from
00:20:10.669 || 00:20:10.679 || that investment because you're in the
00:20:12.049 || 00:20:12.059 || wrong Zone you're going to have a
00:20:14.750 || 00:20:14.760 || problem transferring the the proceeds
00:20:17.750 || 00:20:17.760 || back and everything so so you're exactly
00:20:20.390 || 00:20:20.400 || correct on this multi-polar world what
00:20:22.490 || 00:20:22.500 || we've been in is a unipolar world where
00:20:26.029 || 00:20:26.039 || the for for 20 20 to 25 years the United
00:20:28.789 || 00:20:28.799 || States was kind of the unipolar leader
00:20:31.430 || 00:20:31.440 || of this system this was a globalization
00:20:34.070 || 00:20:34.080 || type system and that's finished and so
00:20:36.470 || 00:20:36.480 || now you're going to have it's very
00:20:38.750 || 00:20:38.760 || difficult to know how this is going to
00:20:40.669 || 00:20:40.679 || work because I know this is tough for
00:20:43.070 || 00:20:43.080 || people but you have to watch these
00:20:44.930 || 00:20:44.940 || things as they evolve but what it looks
00:20:46.010 || 00:20:46.020 || like so far
00:20:48.169 || 00:20:48.179 || is that you have the west and the West
00:20:50.029 || 00:20:50.039 || is going to use the same tools as before
00:20:51.529 || 00:20:51.539 || they're going to probably have a Fed
00:20:54.610 || 00:20:54.620 || coin which is a a digital Central Bank
00:20:57.350 || 00:20:57.360 || blockchain based currency you will not
00:20:59.570 || 00:20:59.580 || be able to make money speculating on the
00:21:01.430 || 00:21:01.440 || value of that currency they're not going
00:21:05.090 || 00:21:05.100 || to use one of the household name 13
00:21:07.250 || 00:21:07.260 || 000 coins that exist I don't use any of
00:21:08.510 || 00:21:08.520 || those they're just going to make their
00:21:10.190 || 00:21:10.200 || own okay and it's going to be closed
00:21:12.409 || 00:21:12.419 || loop system and so you'll have to use
00:21:15.230 || 00:21:15.240 || their their digital fed coin to pay for
00:21:17.630 || 00:21:17.640 || everything and the good news is they'll
00:21:19.970 || 00:21:19.980 || be able to track your every step that
00:21:21.590 || 00:21:21.600 || you take and they'll know exactly what
00:21:24.409 || 00:21:24.419 || you're spending on food or alcohol or
00:21:26.810 || 00:21:26.820 || entertainment or any of these things and
00:21:28.310 || 00:21:28.320 || so you'll love that because you'll be in
00:21:30.470 || 00:21:30.480 || a digital prison and you'll be happy or
00:21:32.510 || 00:21:32.520 || else you know they'll punish you or
00:21:35.510 || 00:21:35.520 || something but then another Zone looks to
00:21:36.529 || 00:21:36.539 || be
00:21:39.110 || 00:21:39.120 || um kind of the the Chinese sphere of
00:21:42.669 || 00:21:42.679 || influence and that's important because
00:21:45.590 || 00:21:45.600 || you're starting to see the Chinese make
00:21:49.490 || 00:21:49.500 || a move move that is is they've planted
00:21:51.890 || 00:21:51.900 || seeds in this in this Belt Road
00:21:53.990 || 00:21:54.000 || initiative that's been going on for some
00:21:55.549 || 00:21:55.559 || time now it's a lot of good books you
00:21:56.990 || 00:21:57.000 || can read about this but essentially
00:21:59.810 || 00:21:59.820 || they're trying to to kind of tell the
00:22:02.810 || 00:22:02.820 || global south of sorts that we respect
00:22:05.930 || 00:22:05.940 || you more than the the Western leaders
00:22:08.510 || 00:22:08.520 || you know we're not going to uh enslave
00:22:10.370 || 00:22:10.380 || you with that
00:22:12.710 || 00:22:12.720 || um uh disturb your local political
00:22:15.950 || 00:22:15.960 || Decisions by funding you know Guerrilla
00:22:18.590 || 00:22:18.600 || groups to murder the person we don't
00:22:20.029 || 00:22:20.039 || like in power we're not going to do that
00:22:21.710 || 00:22:21.720 || what we're going to do is is we're going
00:22:23.750 || 00:22:23.760 || to help you build infrastructure buy
00:22:26.210 || 00:22:26.220 || things from you and uh maintain
00:22:27.890 || 00:22:27.900 || influence here but we're going to let
00:22:29.930 || 00:22:29.940 || you be your own country that's the
00:22:31.310 || 00:22:31.320 || Chinese that's what the Chinese are
00:22:32.870 || 00:22:32.880 || saying I think people really need now
00:22:35.029 || 00:22:35.039 || the Russians are actually saying that
00:22:37.310 || 00:22:37.320 || too but it's very difficult to figure
00:22:39.830 || 00:22:39.840 || out where the Russians fit in right I
00:22:42.409 || 00:22:42.419 || mean it's it's it's not
00:22:44.270 || 00:22:44.280 || um if you just watch the news or
00:22:45.529 || 00:22:45.539 || something you're really at a big
00:22:48.890 || 00:22:48.900 || disadvantage because uh the portrayal of
00:22:51.230 || 00:22:51.240 || Russia is an evil boogeyman is kind of
00:22:52.909 || 00:22:52.919 || stupid you know it's not really the case
00:22:57.409 || 00:22:57.419 || and um so you gotta really wonder what
00:22:59.810 || 00:22:59.820 || the Russians are up to uh because they
00:23:02.390 || 00:23:02.400 || at this point they're minimally aligned
00:23:05.090 || 00:23:05.100 || with the Chinese but at the heart of
00:23:07.190 || 00:23:07.200 || things historically they're not really
00:23:08.810 || 00:23:08.820 || that aligned with the Chinese they're
00:23:11.750 || 00:23:11.760 || much more West Western oriented than you
00:23:13.370 || 00:23:13.380 || would think if you just watch television
00:23:15.830 || 00:23:15.840 || having been there you know numerous
00:23:19.070 || 00:23:19.080 || times and and done conducted investment
00:23:21.289 || 00:23:21.299 || research there years ago when you could
00:23:23.330 || 00:23:23.340 || still do that I can tell you that
00:23:24.950 || 00:23:24.960 || there's a lot more in common with
00:23:27.110 || 00:23:27.120 || European way of thinking than with the
00:23:28.490 || 00:23:28.500 || Chinese way of thinking so it's hard to
00:23:30.049 || 00:23:30.059 || figure out the Russian style but then
00:23:31.850 || 00:23:31.860 || you have countries like India Indonesia
00:23:33.710 || 00:23:33.720 || these are trying to be not aligned and
00:23:34.970 || 00:23:34.980 || what that means is that they're trying
00:23:38.090 || 00:23:38.100 || to to trade with the Chinese contingency
00:23:40.610 || 00:23:40.620 || and the west and so far that's working
00:23:42.289 || 00:23:42.299 || so there are certain countries that are
00:23:44.270 || 00:23:44.280 || that are having a position of neutrality
00:23:46.430 || 00:23:46.440 || not aligning with either side so so
00:23:48.830 || 00:23:48.840 || that's what's happening and people say
00:23:50.810 || 00:23:50.820 || well God this is too much information I
00:23:53.630 || 00:23:53.640 || can't I I understand that if you've been
00:23:55.789 || 00:23:55.799 || on Facebook for the last 10 years and
00:23:57.289 || 00:23:57.299 || you haven't you know read any history
00:23:59.390 || 00:23:59.400 || books this is a lot of information but
00:24:01.789 || 00:24:01.799 || but this is the reality okay so we're
00:24:05.090 || 00:24:05.100 || not going to to candy coat this and and
00:24:07.250 || 00:24:07.260 || like you know tell you some song and
00:24:09.169 || 00:24:09.179 || dance about so this is what's happening
00:24:11.270 || 00:24:11.280 || okay and and this is how the world
00:24:14.270 || 00:24:14.280 || changes this is how the world shifts and
00:24:16.070 || 00:24:16.080 || it's a very centrally planned system and
00:24:17.450 || 00:24:17.460 || I think when you get into these zones
00:24:19.669 || 00:24:19.679 || that the the power elite like these
00:24:21.590 || 00:24:21.600 || zones because because it gives them a
00:24:24.230 || 00:24:24.240 || way to to create uh us against them type
00:24:26.750 || 00:24:26.760 || of tension and everybody's very
00:24:28.610 || 00:24:28.620 || distracted and unable to process
00:24:30.950 || 00:24:30.960 || information so so it's good if you're
00:24:33.049 || 00:24:33.059 || kind of on the power side of things but
00:24:35.750 || 00:24:35.760 || but if you're a thinking person you have
00:24:38.630 || 00:24:38.640 || to look at this chessboard now and see
00:24:41.090 || 00:24:41.100 || how it's evolving because this is going
00:24:43.909 || 00:24:43.919 || to have a huge effect on how you
00:24:45.409 || 00:24:45.419 || position yourself
00:24:48.110 || 00:24:48.120 || going forward and and uh and you know
00:24:50.090 || 00:24:50.100 || it's it's it's it's I know it's probably
00:24:53.210 || 00:24:53.220 || for people it's it seems boring but I
00:24:55.130 || 00:24:55.140 || spend a lot of time doing this and and
00:24:56.570 || 00:24:56.580 || it's worked out very well for me because
00:24:59.510 || 00:24:59.520 || you you tend to you tend to
00:25:02.810 || 00:25:02.820 || um avoid huge catastrophic blows because
00:25:04.970 || 00:25:04.980 || you because you see something you see
00:25:07.490 || 00:25:07.500 || the grass bent over and you already know
00:25:09.710 || 00:25:09.720 || the wind is blowing and you you've been
00:25:10.630 || 00:25:10.640 || able to
00:25:14.450 || 00:25:14.460 || avoid the hurricane so uh that's
00:25:16.190 || 00:25:16.200 || happening that's that's that's the world
00:25:18.350 || 00:25:18.360 || we live in right now and gold it's to
00:25:19.789 || 00:25:19.799 || some degree is a bit of an island right
00:25:23.510 || 00:25:23.520 || because if you have some gold you I do
00:25:24.890 || 00:25:24.900 || not believe you're going to be able to
00:25:25.850 || 00:25:25.860 || buy
00:25:28.070 || 00:25:28.080 || precious metals
00:25:31.669 || 00:25:31.679 || um without being uh recorded your
00:25:33.710 || 00:25:33.720 || transaction being recorded and I think
00:25:35.090 || 00:25:35.100 || that's already the case now I think it's
00:25:37.130 || 00:25:37.140 || going to be significantly worse and in
00:25:39.529 || 00:25:39.539 || fact I think they'll brand people that
00:25:42.169 || 00:25:42.179 || try to use their fed coin to buy
00:25:43.789 || 00:25:43.799 || physical metal I think they'll brand
00:25:45.669 || 00:25:45.679 || them some sort of like dangerous
00:25:48.169 || 00:25:48.179 || subversive and
00:25:49.430 || 00:25:49.440 || um because they'll say why would you
00:25:50.690 || 00:25:50.700 || want that you know why would you need
00:25:52.190 || 00:25:52.200 || that are you up to something I think
00:25:53.870 || 00:25:53.880 || that's coming that's definitely coming
00:25:56.450 || 00:25:56.460 || and so and so when you look at your gold
00:25:58.669 || 00:25:58.679 || you say like this is not an investment
00:26:02.870 || 00:26:02.880 || this is this is this is uh an island and
00:26:04.730 || 00:26:04.740 || you don't need a big island you don't
00:26:06.230 || 00:26:06.240 || you really don't need a p I think people
00:26:08.269 || 00:26:08.279 || get this wrong all the time I mean you
00:26:09.830 || 00:26:09.840 || you know you I think I think you
00:26:12.350 || 00:26:12.360 || personally think you'd be nuts to to
00:26:14.510 || 00:26:14.520 || have you know like 80 physical metal
00:26:16.669 || 00:26:16.679 || portfolio I mean I think
00:26:18.590 || 00:26:18.600 || the only way I think that works is if
00:26:21.350 || 00:26:21.360 || you're super rich you know that then you
00:26:22.610 || 00:26:22.620 || don't care anymore because you don't
00:26:24.890 || 00:26:24.900 || care about making money you don't care
00:26:27.409 || 00:26:27.419 || at all you know you you you're out of a
00:26:29.330 || 00:26:29.340 || money game right but but if you're
00:26:32.330 || 00:26:32.340 || working I mean I I personally I I did
00:26:34.430 || 00:26:34.440 || not grow up poor but I personally did
00:26:37.070 || 00:26:37.080 || not start out with with a
00:26:40.250 || 00:26:40.260 || serious money at all and and so you know
00:26:43.190 || 00:26:43.200 || you think about it gold is up 500 or
00:26:45.049 || 00:26:45.059 || something since the beginning of the
00:26:46.850 || 00:26:46.860 || century okay
00:26:50.510 || 00:26:50.520 || and that's great because a house costs
00:26:53.149 || 00:26:53.159 || about 500 more too it's something like
00:26:55.310 || 00:26:55.320 || basically you know it's not really been
00:26:57.710 || 00:26:57.720 || something that that's had a huge some
00:27:00.230 || 00:27:00.240 || sort of speculative Mania right it
00:27:01.549 || 00:27:01.559 || doesn't really work that way you know
00:27:03.830 || 00:27:03.840 || it's kind of like Rock Solid money
00:27:07.669 || 00:27:07.679 || that's that's disconnected from the
00:27:09.289 || 00:27:09.299 || evolving world that we're talking about
00:27:11.630 || 00:27:11.640 || and kind of coming full circle here then
00:27:14.330 || 00:27:14.340 || as we see this multi-polar world and
00:27:16.490 || 00:27:16.500 || possibly as some I mean definitely
00:27:17.990 || 00:27:18.000 || countries being more interested in
00:27:20.690 || 00:27:20.700 || Precious Metals uh how do you see that
00:27:23.510 || 00:27:23.520 || impacting precious metals and maybe in
00:27:26.390 || 00:27:26.400 || 2023 yeah okay so the thing to to
00:27:28.430 || 00:27:28.440 || remember is during the unipolar world it
00:27:30.169 || 00:27:30.179 || was all you got to hold dollars that's
00:27:31.610 || 00:27:31.620 || the deal you got to hold dollars if you
00:27:32.930 || 00:27:32.940 || want to do stuff and so these countries
00:27:34.430 || 00:27:34.440 || are now saying wait a second maybe we
00:27:36.169 || 00:27:36.179 || hold a few less dollars what are we
00:27:37.250 || 00:27:37.260 || going to hold we're gonna hold Euros
00:27:38.690 || 00:27:38.700 || well that has problems so we're going to
00:27:41.029 || 00:27:41.039 || hold rubles so that's his major problems
00:27:42.710 || 00:27:42.720 || because we we can't put them anywhere
00:27:44.810 || 00:27:44.820 || are we going to hold you on well that
00:27:46.549 || 00:27:46.559 || has problems because because there's not
00:27:49.070 || 00:27:49.080 || a good mechanism to do that right now so
00:27:51.830 || 00:27:51.840 || maybe we have a little bit more gold so
00:27:54.590 || 00:27:54.600 || yes that's why we saw last year the
00:27:56.570 || 00:27:56.580 || Central Bank buying was so big and I
00:27:58.130 || 00:27:58.140 || think I think you're going to see an
00:27:59.930 || 00:27:59.940 || uptick I think you're going to see an
00:28:01.909 || 00:28:01.919 || uptick in that because because the world
00:28:04.190 || 00:28:04.200 || is now becoming nervous to have so many
00:28:05.810 || 00:28:05.820 || dollars I mean when the Russia thing
00:28:07.730 || 00:28:07.740 || happened last year there were massive
00:28:09.529 || 00:28:09.539 || dollar accounts Frozen
00:28:11.810 || 00:28:11.820 || countries had their dollar accounts
00:28:13.490 || 00:28:13.500 || Frozen I mean think about that for a
00:28:16.250 || 00:28:16.260 || minute that's crazy right I mean this is
00:28:18.590 || 00:28:18.600 || a free market it's not a free market you
00:28:20.450 || 00:28:20.460 || know you have they have the West has a
00:28:22.850 || 00:28:22.860 || huge amount of control over over where
00:28:24.769 || 00:28:24.779 || those dollars go and they're going to
00:28:26.810 || 00:28:26.820 || flex that control and I think that
00:28:29.870 || 00:28:29.880 || that's that less powerful nations are
00:28:31.549 || 00:28:31.559 || concerned about that and I think that's
00:28:33.409 || 00:28:33.419 || the move that's going to be the move
00:28:35.450 || 00:28:35.460 || into gold and it's going to be difficult
00:28:38.029 || 00:28:38.039 || to for people to see that so let's
00:28:39.950 || 00:28:39.960 || let's kind of wrap up with a couple
00:28:42.950 || 00:28:42.960 || things like one it because we've kind of
00:28:45.409 || 00:28:45.419 || told people what we see happening which
00:28:47.510 || 00:28:47.520 || I'm happy to come back later and we can
00:28:49.490 || 00:28:49.500 || revisit and you know down the road and
00:28:50.930 || 00:28:50.940 || see if we were accurate or not I think
00:28:54.110 || 00:28:54.120 || we'll be accurate but but my book if
00:28:55.730 || 00:28:55.740 || people haven't read my book you can get
00:28:57.769 || 00:28:57.779 || the book on Amazon audible all these
00:29:00.289 || 00:29:00.299 || things the book is is not expensive and
00:29:02.470 || 00:29:02.480 || the the book is really a start to finish
00:29:05.330 || 00:29:05.340 || book inside my head as to how I think
00:29:07.970 || 00:29:07.980 || about gold and what you'll see when
00:29:09.529 || 00:29:09.539 || you're done or you can listen to the
00:29:11.090 || 00:29:11.100 || thing on Audible go take a walk outside
00:29:14.269 || 00:29:14.279 || listen to it uh is that is that the
00:29:16.250 || 00:29:16.260 || physical goal is important but also the
00:29:19.190 || 00:29:19.200 || gold royalty company that I helped start
00:29:21.230 || 00:29:21.240 || the towel royalty trades the New York
00:29:23.210 || 00:29:23.220 || Stock Exchange is a huge piece of the
00:29:24.950 || 00:29:24.960 || puzzle right because because the royalty
00:29:27.049 || 00:29:27.059 || gives you this like multi-decade
00:29:30.169 || 00:29:30.179 || exposure to Future gold production and
00:29:31.549 || 00:29:31.559 || you don't pay anything for that I mean
00:29:34.010 || 00:29:34.020 || you pay for it to start but if the gold
00:29:36.769 || 00:29:36.779 || price goes to 2 000 the value of the
00:29:39.649 || 00:29:39.659 || royalty 30 years from now is a gigantic
00:29:42.710 || 00:29:42.720 || increase because because the inflation
00:29:44.990 || 00:29:45.000 || that's happening right now is good for
00:29:46.610 || 00:29:46.620 || the royalty company if it costs more
00:29:47.870 || 00:29:47.880 || money to get the gold out of the ground
00:29:49.610 || 00:29:49.620 || royalty company doesn't care so
00:29:51.590 || 00:29:51.600 || basically if the price of fuel goes up
00:29:54.110 || 00:29:54.120 || royalty company gets one percent of all
00:29:56.029 || 00:29:56.039 || the gold you produce it doesn't matter
00:29:57.529 || 00:29:57.539 || if it costs more to produce it they get
00:29:59.149 || 00:29:59.159 || one percent so I think people need to
00:30:01.010 || 00:30:01.020 || understand that that this is a total
00:30:02.990 || 00:30:03.000 || picture you know it's not it's not
00:30:04.850 || 00:30:04.860 || something from my position where you
00:30:06.830 || 00:30:06.840 || just go do all this or all that or
00:30:08.630 || 00:30:08.640 || something and the royalty company last
00:30:11.750 || 00:30:11.760 || year I mean metal was down 29 last year
00:30:15.169 || 00:30:15.179 || in the US and and it sounds like really
00:30:16.850 || 00:30:16.860 || really bad right but it wasn't down as
00:30:19.549 || 00:30:19.559 || much as Facebook okay so I mean think
00:30:21.289 || 00:30:21.299 || about it but all right so when you went
00:30:24.230 || 00:30:24.240 || down 29 and the gold price was flat I
00:30:27.110 || 00:30:27.120 || mean that's that shows you how bad the
00:30:29.570 || 00:30:29.580 || market was in stocks and and when I look
00:30:31.310 || 00:30:31.320 || at that I just think that's got to
00:30:32.750 || 00:30:32.760 || correct you know that that doesn't make
00:30:35.510 || 00:30:35.520 || any sense and uh the gold price if the
00:30:37.070 || 00:30:37.080 || gold price goes up the value of those
00:30:39.350 || 00:30:39.360 || royalties goes up lot more and unlike
00:30:42.049 || 00:30:42.059 || physical gold the gold royalty is a
00:30:43.549 || 00:30:43.559 || tradable asset I mean that's something
00:30:46.190 || 00:30:46.200 || that does move up and down based on the
00:30:48.169 || 00:30:48.179 || speculative tenor of the market last
00:30:50.389 || 00:30:50.399 || year was a bad year for speculative
00:30:53.269 || 00:30:53.279 || stocks and you see that in metallic but
00:30:55.130 || 00:30:55.140 || I think people need to see that full
00:30:58.370 || 00:30:58.380 || picture so so where I'd like to leave
00:31:00.889 || 00:31:00.899 || people is you know please read my book
00:31:03.230 || 00:31:03.240 || or listen to my my book I've tried to
00:31:05.810 || 00:31:05.820 || make it as accessible as possible and as
00:31:08.149 || 00:31:08.159 || cheap as possible and
00:31:10.310 || 00:31:10.320 || um and consider what I've done with the
00:31:12.529 || 00:31:12.539 || royalty business because I didn't do
00:31:15.230 || 00:31:15.240 || that I I I didn't do that because I'm
00:31:16.789 || 00:31:16.799 || crazy I mean it was very well thought
00:31:19.190 || 00:31:19.200 || out right I mean it was a very there's a
00:31:21.409 || 00:31:21.419 || lot that's behind that and and I think
00:31:23.690 || 00:31:23.700 || people once they see kind of what we
00:31:25.010 || 00:31:25.020 || were thinking when we put that together
00:31:27.409 || 00:31:27.419 || there's a huge amount of insight and and
00:31:28.310 || 00:31:28.320 || and
00:31:30.470 || 00:31:30.480 || um that Insight you know is yours once
00:31:32.450 || 00:31:32.460 || you once you see it it's yours to keep
00:31:34.549 || 00:31:34.559 || right that's the beauty of learning
00:31:35.630 || 00:31:35.640 || about something
00:31:37.669 || 00:31:37.679 || in a simple way is that you take that
00:31:39.289 || 00:31:39.299 || knowledge with you to the next thing and
00:31:41.810 || 00:31:41.820 || people listening and watching need to
00:31:43.010 || 00:31:43.020 || realize that that's what you should be
00:31:45.470 || 00:31:45.480 || doing and there's not an answer for you
00:31:47.930 || 00:31:47.940 || the process of learning especially when
00:31:49.970 || 00:31:49.980 || someone makes it easy for you is very
00:31:51.830 || 00:31:51.840 || powerful and you you take that to the
00:31:53.510 || 00:31:53.520 || next Market that you go to in the next
00:31:55.190 || 00:31:55.200 || Market the next market and before you
00:31:56.510 || 00:31:56.520 || know it you don't need us anymore
00:31:58.190 || 00:31:58.200 || because you're able to think for
00:32:00.470 || 00:32:00.480 || yourself and that that's where I hope
00:32:02.810 || 00:32:02.820 || people realize that that that's where
00:32:04.850 || 00:32:04.860 || the real magic happens
00:32:07.310 || 00:32:07.320 || I think it is a very interesting what
00:32:09.350 || 00:32:09.360 || you say about precious metals and really
00:32:11.269 || 00:32:11.279 || as you mentioned their money and at the
00:32:13.190 || 00:32:13.200 || end of the day that's what they are it's
00:32:15.169 || 00:32:15.179 || not like you should go into them looking
00:32:17.090 || 00:32:17.100 || for big returns but when it comes to the
00:32:19.250 || 00:32:19.260 || stocks for example royalty companies I
00:32:20.389 || 00:32:20.399 || think that's a very interesting
00:32:22.430 || 00:32:22.440 || perspective I'm a holder of royalty
00:32:25.070 || 00:32:25.080 || companies including matala and
00:32:28.370 || 00:32:28.380 || um I think it's at least right now with
00:32:29.870 || 00:32:29.880 || inflation I think it's such an
00:32:32.570 || 00:32:32.580 || interesting Play Because often royalty
00:32:35.149 || 00:32:35.159 || companies can be kind of immune to the
00:32:36.769 || 00:32:36.779 || input costs so you don't they don't have
00:32:38.630 || 00:32:38.640 || a lot of input costs that are subject to
00:32:42.110 || 00:32:42.120 || inflation so if gold increases they're
00:32:44.330 || 00:32:44.340 || not going to be having increased input
00:32:47.210 || 00:32:47.220 || costs a lot of the time like uh mining
00:32:49.250 || 00:32:49.260 || companies do yeah I mean think about it
00:32:51.769 || 00:32:51.779 || Mattel has like five employees
00:32:55.070 || 00:32:55.080 || I mean a mining company has like you
00:32:57.529 || 00:32:57.539 || know fifteen thousand I mean it's it's
00:32:59.990 || 00:33:00.000 || like talk about overhead problems I mean
00:33:02.870 || 00:33:02.880 || metallic metallic can't even have an HR
00:33:04.789 || 00:33:04.799 || department because you got like two
00:33:06.710 || 00:33:06.720 || employees in Toronto and two employees
00:33:10.070 || 00:33:10.080 || in Vancouver and you tell them like you
00:33:11.930 || 00:33:11.940 || know if you guys have a disagreement
00:33:14.330 || 00:33:14.340 || sorted out because because I mean we
00:33:16.490 || 00:33:16.500 || can't even what are we supposed to do
00:33:18.470 || 00:33:18.480 || it's not even we can barely find an
00:33:20.930 || 00:33:20.940 || Office suitable because there's only two
00:33:23.149 || 00:33:23.159 || of you right it's hard to even find a
00:33:26.029 || 00:33:26.039 || space that that small so to your point
00:33:27.769 || 00:33:27.779 || yeah you don't have you don't have these
00:33:30.769 || 00:33:30.779 || costs and and last year what people
00:33:33.110 || 00:33:33.120 || didn't notice was that metallic boosted
00:33:34.909 || 00:33:34.919 || the number of royalties over 80 I mean
00:33:36.830 || 00:33:36.840 || this is now it's over 80 royalties it's
00:33:39.110 || 00:33:39.120 || crazy and so you got these royalties
00:33:41.029 || 00:33:41.039 || well the price went down what that means
00:33:43.549 || 00:33:43.559 || is unlike me buying the car we're gonna
00:33:45.830 || 00:33:45.840 || pay up for it you now you've got more
00:33:49.009 || 00:33:49.019 || royalties okay at a lower price and
00:33:50.990 || 00:33:51.000 || people are like well I only want to buy
00:33:53.389 || 00:33:53.399 || the stock when the top AI okay I thought
00:33:55.370 || 00:33:55.380 || you told me you'd like to buy low sell
00:33:58.190 || 00:33:58.200 || High well yeah I do okay well here's
00:34:00.950 || 00:34:00.960 || your chance so basically and then the
00:34:03.409 || 00:34:03.419 || nine competitors were have been bought
00:34:06.889 || 00:34:06.899 || in the last 20 months nine competitors
00:34:09.770 || 00:34:09.780 || crazy it's absolutely crazy I mean you
00:34:11.869 || 00:34:11.879 || know people say well well you get bought
00:34:13.430 || 00:34:13.440 || I mean well obviously I don't know that
00:34:15.710 || 00:34:15.720 || so and if I did know that I couldn't
00:34:18.109 || 00:34:18.119 || tell you anyway so basically but the
00:34:21.050 || 00:34:21.060 || point is is is is that it's on sale
00:34:24.169 || 00:34:24.179 || right now and even Franco Nevada had a
00:34:26.149 || 00:34:26.159 || tough year last year and and Royal gold
00:34:28.190 || 00:34:28.200 || was up maybe eight percent the best year
00:34:30.889 || 00:34:30.899 || but Mavericks was bought by triple flag
00:34:34.070 || 00:34:34.080 || and and uh Nomad was bought by Sandstorm
00:34:35.810 || 00:34:35.820 || and I mean you know all these companies
00:34:38.149 || 00:34:38.159 || are gone they're all gone so I mean what
00:34:39.530 || 00:34:39.540 || are you gonna buy there's nothing left
00:34:41.869 || 00:34:41.879 || to buy I mean so
00:34:44.629 || 00:34:44.639 || um I I just I just think if people can
00:34:47.270 || 00:34:47.280 || see what the royalty is I mean the the
00:34:50.990 || 00:34:51.000 || the the royalty is is the the root word
00:34:55.730 || 00:34:55.740 || is Royal okay Royal royalty Royal okay
00:34:58.670 || 00:34:58.680 || so if you were a royal and you ruled an
00:34:59.690 || 00:34:59.700 || area
00:35:02.329 || 00:35:02.339 || you would take one percent of all the
00:35:04.910 || 00:35:04.920 || productive activity in your area and you
00:35:06.710 || 00:35:06.720 || would say to the merchant in the shop
00:35:08.329 || 00:35:08.339 || you're going to pay me one percent or
00:35:09.530 || 00:35:09.540 || I'm going to slice your head off okay
00:35:11.210 || 00:35:11.220 || that's that's going to be our
00:35:13.670 || 00:35:13.680 || Arrangement and why would you do that
00:35:15.829 || 00:35:15.839 || because you don't want to get involved
00:35:18.589 || 00:35:18.599 || in the nitty-gritty of of actually
00:35:20.210 || 00:35:20.220 || running the shop you don't care about
00:35:22.730 || 00:35:22.740 || that that's peasant work okay you take
00:35:25.069 || 00:35:25.079 || one percent think about in the United
00:35:26.569 || 00:35:26.579 || States you have something called sales
00:35:29.030 || 00:35:29.040 || tax not everywhere but not in New
00:35:30.910 || 00:35:30.920 || Hampshire but you have it in Most states
00:35:34.730 || 00:35:34.740 || and sales tax means that I go buy a cup
00:35:36.890 || 00:35:36.900 || of coffee for three dollars and I pay 21
00:35:38.690 || 00:35:38.700 || cents to the county
00:35:40.849 || 00:35:40.859 || what did the county do for me very
00:35:43.550 || 00:35:43.560 || little they they sent in a brain dead
00:35:45.589 || 00:35:45.599 || inspector to make sure that the place
00:35:47.750 || 00:35:47.760 || wasn't putrid smelling they did that
00:35:49.790 || 00:35:49.800 || about once a year and most the time you
00:35:51.349 || 00:35:51.359 || give that guy a free cup of coffee he
00:35:54.230 || 00:35:54.240 || leaves all right that's a royalty that
00:35:56.390 || 00:35:56.400 || that means that the price of coffee goes
00:35:58.430 || 00:35:58.440 || up the price let's say there's coffee
00:36:00.349 || 00:36:00.359 || inflation and the coffee price goes to
00:36:03.950 || 00:36:03.960 || five dollars the county is thrilled
00:36:07.910 || 00:36:07.920 || because the seven percent tax is now 35
00:36:09.290 || 00:36:09.300 || cents
00:36:11.630 || 00:36:11.640 || they did nothing to help you 30 okay so
00:36:13.790 || 00:36:13.800 || if people can see this
00:36:16.130 || 00:36:16.140 || they could see the power in the royalty
00:36:19.609 || 00:36:19.619 || it's very very different from owning
00:36:22.790 || 00:36:22.800 || stock in a company that's facing Rising
00:36:24.349 || 00:36:24.359 || input costs
00:36:26.930 || 00:36:26.940 || difficult labor markets geopolitical
00:36:31.010 || 00:36:31.020 || tension the royalty is a powerful tool
00:36:33.109 || 00:36:33.119 || in an inflationary environment and
00:36:35.390 || 00:36:35.400 || that's why I wrote the book was because
00:36:37.790 || 00:36:37.800 || I did not feel like people understood
00:36:40.670 || 00:36:40.680 || what the royalty is if they could
00:36:42.790 || 00:36:42.800 || understand what I saw in the royalty
00:36:45.470 || 00:36:45.480 || perhaps they would be as excited as I am
00:36:47.329 || 00:36:47.339 || when I got the chance to put the company
00:36:49.910 || 00:36:49.920 || together with Brett Heath who's really
00:36:52.670 || 00:36:52.680 || the Master of Ceremonies uh
00:36:55.490 || 00:36:55.500 || I I jumped all over it because I I
00:36:57.589 || 00:36:57.599 || thought I would if I could go back to
00:36:59.870 || 00:36:59.880 || the 80s and Pierre lassan called me and
00:37:01.190 || 00:37:01.200 || said would you like to start Franco
00:37:03.650 || 00:37:03.660 || Nevada I would have said excuse the
00:37:06.829 || 00:37:06.839 || noise I'm I'm trying to Sprint to
00:37:09.230 || 00:37:09.240 || Toronto to meet you so it's like so
00:37:11.810 || 00:37:11.820 || that's my enthusiasm level knowing what
00:37:14.329 || 00:37:14.339 || I know about royalties and I don't care
00:37:16.910 || 00:37:16.920 || if the price is down 29 or if the price
00:37:20.990 || 00:37:21.000 || is down 50 I don't care because I'm more
00:37:22.970 || 00:37:22.980 || much more concerned about what I own
00:37:25.849 || 00:37:25.859 || than the price if I owned pancake coin
00:37:28.250 || 00:37:28.260 || and the price was only down 10 I would
00:37:31.250 || 00:37:31.260 || be extremely concerned about my assets
00:37:34.010 || 00:37:34.020 || if I own the royalty that I put together
00:37:37.490 || 00:37:37.500 || it's down 29 I could care less and
00:37:39.589 || 00:37:39.599 || people say oh yeah well easy for you to
00:37:42.109 || 00:37:42.119 || say yeah you know what guys I'm not a
00:37:44.630 || 00:37:44.640 || billionaire okay and you know I'm in
00:37:47.329 || 00:37:47.339 || this game to I'm also I'm not quite as
00:37:49.790 || 00:37:49.800 || young as I look but I I'm in this game
00:37:52.490 || 00:37:52.500 || to profit all right I'm not I'm not in
00:37:55.670 || 00:37:55.680 || this as a charity operation and the way
00:37:57.890 || 00:37:57.900 || I profit is if my royalty company
00:37:59.690 || 00:37:59.700 || succeeds and
00:38:02.510 || 00:38:02.520 || my opinion is time will tell if I'm
00:38:04.670 || 00:38:04.680 || right or not but my opinion is if the
00:38:06.710 || 00:38:06.720 || gold price moves an inch the royalty
00:38:09.410 || 00:38:09.420 || company moves them a mile okay so that's
00:38:11.569 || 00:38:11.579 || that's why I own that and and if I'm
00:38:13.730 || 00:38:13.740 || wrong then I'm wrong you're not always
00:38:15.290 || 00:38:15.300 || going to be right in life it's not
00:38:18.710 || 00:38:18.720 || possible to always be right and um but
00:38:20.329 || 00:38:20.339 || this is the year for it and so let's
00:38:23.810 || 00:38:23.820 || let's let's uh sign off and later in the
00:38:25.849 || 00:38:25.859 || year we can come back and see if what we
00:38:26.569 || 00:38:26.579 || said
00:38:29.690 || 00:38:29.700 || held water I'm happy to to face the
00:38:31.730 || 00:38:31.740 || music if we were wrong
