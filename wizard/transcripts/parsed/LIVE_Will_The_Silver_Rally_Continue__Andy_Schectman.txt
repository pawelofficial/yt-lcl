00:00:54.470 || 00:00:54.480 || so anyway
00:00:55.270 || 00:00:55.280 || um
00:00:57.750 || 00:00:57.760 || uh i was about to mention that today was
00:01:00.470 || 00:01:00.480 || touted as the worst day on wall street
00:01:01.910 || 00:01:01.920 || in the past two years and that's saying
00:01:03.189 || 00:01:03.199 || something given that we've been through
00:01:04.869 || 00:01:04.879 || a pandemic and
00:01:07.750 || 00:01:07.760 || global lockdowns and who knows what all
00:01:08.870 || 00:01:08.880 || but
00:01:10.310 || 00:01:10.320 || that's interesting because i keep
00:01:12.710 || 00:01:12.720 || getting couple after couple after couple
00:01:15.590 || 00:01:15.600 || calling me and saying we want to get our
00:01:17.510 || 00:01:17.520 || nest egg out of harm's way
00:01:19.749 || 00:01:19.759 || and it's been all the way from very very
00:01:20.789 || 00:01:20.799 || small
00:01:21.990 || 00:01:22.000 || modest
00:01:24.310 || 00:01:24.320 || amounts up to multi
00:01:26.710 || 00:01:26.720 || multi-family uh trusts where they get
00:01:28.390 || 00:01:28.400 || five trusts in the family and they gotta
00:01:30.230 || 00:01:30.240 || get them all out of there and it's uh
00:01:32.069 || 00:01:32.079 || it's a remarkable time
00:01:33.510 || 00:01:33.520 || and anyway that's what a lot of the
00:01:36.390 || 00:01:36.400 || chatter has been about in the lives chat
00:01:38.230 || 00:01:38.240 || has been about what is going on with the
00:01:40.550 || 00:01:40.560 || markets and uh people have been
00:01:41.830 || 00:01:41.840 || mentioning that they saw you interviewed
00:01:44.630 || 00:01:44.640 || on vicks weir's show and talking about
00:01:46.789 || 00:01:46.799 || what's coming next so
00:01:49.270 || 00:01:49.280 || without any uh further
00:01:51.590 || 00:01:51.600 || uh delays wanted to give you a chance to
00:01:54.789 || 00:01:54.799 || give us your take on this eventful day
00:01:56.230 || 00:01:56.240 || the worst day on wall street in two
00:01:58.630 || 00:01:58.640 || years and then we'll uh go ahead and get
00:02:01.670 || 00:02:01.680 || into viewers questions yeah look hey man
00:02:04.630 || 00:02:04.640 || look it's long overdue i mean
00:02:07.510 || 00:02:07.520 || the valuations that we see in equity
00:02:09.510 || 00:02:09.520 || markets are
00:02:11.830 || 00:02:11.840 || are or have been for quite some time
00:02:13.750 || 00:02:13.760 || stratospheric and i
00:02:15.190 || 00:02:15.200 || i think that
00:02:17.110 || 00:02:17.120 || um
00:02:18.229 || 00:02:18.239 || you know the
00:02:21.430 || 00:02:21.440 || the way the cpi numbers came out today
00:02:22.470 || 00:02:22.480 || and the
00:02:23.830 || 00:02:23.840 || the
00:02:25.430 || 00:02:25.440 || belief that
00:02:26.229 || 00:02:26.239 || the
00:02:29.110 || 00:02:29.120 || fed will raise rates again
00:02:32.630 || 00:02:32.640 || by 75 basis points or 100 basis points
00:02:34.710 || 00:02:34.720 || whatever it may be has spooked the
00:02:36.949 || 00:02:36.959 || market but one of the things that i
00:02:39.350 || 00:02:39.360 || always find interesting about the market
00:02:43.589 || 00:02:43.599 || is just how reactionary it truly is and
00:02:45.750 || 00:02:45.760 || that i think is a mistake when when
00:02:48.150 || 00:02:48.160 || you're talking about investing and you
00:02:49.350 || 00:02:49.360 || know you look at
00:02:51.509 || 00:02:51.519 || the chinese they think in terms of
00:02:54.390 || 00:02:54.400 || decades and we think in terms of seconds
00:02:57.030 || 00:02:57.040 || here in in the west and you get
00:02:59.110 || 00:02:59.120 || information that everyone
00:03:01.589 || 00:03:01.599 || really deep down i think
00:03:04.309 || 00:03:04.319 || understands has to happen we have to see
00:03:06.390 || 00:03:06.400 || rates rise
00:03:08.869 || 00:03:08.879 || and you know
00:03:11.190 || 00:03:11.200 || you see some numbers that make make it
00:03:12.630 || 00:03:12.640 || evident that they're going to continue
00:03:13.990 || 00:03:14.000 || to
00:03:15.350 || 00:03:15.360 || tighten they're going to continue to
00:03:17.990 || 00:03:18.000 || raise rates and the market has knee-jerk
00:03:20.229 || 00:03:20.239 || reactions i think you have to be
00:03:22.229 || 00:03:22.239 || proactive we've seen for the last
00:03:23.589 || 00:03:23.599 || several weeks
00:03:26.070 || 00:03:26.080 || uh insider selling at record pace the
00:03:28.710 || 00:03:28.720 || insiders are selling on strength and for
00:03:30.789 || 00:03:30.799 || whatever reason hope springs eternal in
00:03:32.550 || 00:03:32.560 || the equity markets and look it's been
00:03:35.030 || 00:03:35.040 || that way for a long time um
00:03:37.509 || 00:03:37.519 || and i think recency bias makes most
00:03:39.509 || 00:03:39.519 || people believe that you know just hang
00:03:41.990 || 00:03:42.000 || on have strong fingertips and you know
00:03:43.670 || 00:03:43.680 || it will all come back it will all be
00:03:45.110 || 00:03:45.120 || okay
00:03:47.270 || 00:03:47.280 || this time i think it's different and i
00:03:49.670 || 00:03:49.680 || think that the floor really is a long
00:03:52.390 || 00:03:52.400 || way down it may not be this move maybe
00:03:55.350 || 00:03:55.360 || it is i don't know but price discovery
00:03:58.229 || 00:03:58.239 || and valuations have been distorted to to
00:04:00.390 || 00:04:00.400 || the umpteenth degree
00:04:01.830 || 00:04:01.840 || um where
00:04:03.990 || 00:04:04.000 || you know more money created in the last
00:04:05.589 || 00:04:05.599 || three years than in the history of this
00:04:07.350 || 00:04:07.360 || country the majority of it going into
00:04:09.589 || 00:04:09.599 || equity portfolios into real estate into
00:04:11.750 || 00:04:11.760 || cryptocurrencies where
00:04:14.630 || 00:04:14.640 || people have become i think they've drank
00:04:16.550 || 00:04:16.560 || their own kool-aid in their respect that
00:04:18.870 || 00:04:18.880 || i know that this house that i bought a
00:04:21.509 || 00:04:21.519 || year ago or 18 months ago or 15 months
00:04:22.390 || 00:04:22.400 || ago
00:04:24.469 || 00:04:24.479 || really is not worth twice what i paid
00:04:26.710 || 00:04:26.720 || for it yet that's what
00:04:28.629 || 00:04:28.639 || you know that's what the real estate
00:04:30.070 || 00:04:30.080 || agents in this neighborhood would have
00:04:32.469 || 00:04:32.479 || you believe and um and i know for the
00:04:34.550 || 00:04:34.560 || same you know by the same token that
00:04:37.189 || 00:04:37.199 || equity portfolios are not double what
00:04:39.270 || 00:04:39.280 || they were three years ago in terms of
00:04:41.110 || 00:04:41.120 || fundamental strength
00:04:43.670 || 00:04:43.680 || this is just a situation where where i
00:04:45.909 || 00:04:45.919 || believe prices have gotten so far out of
00:04:48.230 || 00:04:48.240 || whack that they really do need to come
00:04:50.390 || 00:04:50.400 || down and i think even though it was a
00:04:53.189 || 00:04:53.199 || big move down percentage-wise it wasn't
00:04:55.430 || 00:04:55.440 || that extraordinary i i think that
00:04:58.150 || 00:04:58.160 || there'll be many more days like this
00:05:00.710 || 00:05:00.720 || whether it be by the fed tightening and
00:05:02.790 || 00:05:02.800 || the reactions to the market or as i've
00:05:05.590 || 00:05:05.600 || been talking about for a very long time
00:05:07.830 || 00:05:07.840 || ad nauseam um
00:05:11.430 || 00:05:11.440 || something that happens eastward that
00:05:13.909 || 00:05:13.919 || makes the market move in and of itself
00:05:15.749 || 00:05:15.759 || where the market
00:05:17.830 || 00:05:17.840 || and the the
00:05:20.870 || 00:05:20.880 || real market controls the price movement
00:05:24.230 || 00:05:24.240 || and the action not the manipulation of
00:05:26.070 || 00:05:26.080 || the commercial banks trying to mitigate
00:05:27.590 || 00:05:27.600 || the rise or the fall
00:05:30.550 || 00:05:30.560 || of of assets so look this is long
00:05:32.150 || 00:05:32.160 || overdue done again and i think there's
00:05:33.830 || 00:05:33.840 || going to be many more of these and i
00:05:35.350 || 00:05:35.360 || think people just need to get the heck
00:05:37.830 || 00:05:37.840 || out of the way right now and let this
00:05:40.230 || 00:05:40.240 || all calm down and if you have money in
00:05:41.830 || 00:05:41.840 || the markets there's nothing wrong with
00:05:43.590 || 00:05:43.600 || sitting on the sidelines whether or not
00:05:45.110 || 00:05:45.120 || you believe you should be in precious
00:05:47.510 || 00:05:47.520 || metals is not really
00:05:49.830 || 00:05:49.840 || the issue here the issue is that asset
00:05:52.150 || 00:05:52.160 || prices are distorted and they need to
00:05:54.230 || 00:05:54.240 || find equilibrium with with interest
00:05:55.350 || 00:05:55.360 || rates and
00:05:57.029 || 00:05:57.039 || you know even interest rates if they
00:05:58.710 || 00:05:58.720 || raise them another hundred basis points
00:06:00.390 || 00:06:00.400 || are one percent to three and a quarter
00:06:02.870 || 00:06:02.880 || percent we are still based upon the
00:06:05.029 || 00:06:05.039 || current cpi numbers we would still be
00:06:07.590 || 00:06:07.600 || negative real terms over five percent
00:06:10.390 || 00:06:10.400 || there's a long way to go to find
00:06:12.710 || 00:06:12.720 || equilibrium in this market to find
00:06:15.510 || 00:06:15.520 || rational interest rates and to
00:06:17.749 || 00:06:17.759 || you know when you when you when you are
00:06:21.110 || 00:06:21.120 || receiving um
00:06:23.350 || 00:06:23.360 || a negative five percent return on fixed
00:06:26.870 || 00:06:26.880 || income investments we have a long way to
00:06:28.950 || 00:06:28.960 || go and i i think you know this is just
00:06:30.790 || 00:06:30.800 || the very beginning
00:06:32.469 || 00:06:32.479 || we've got some questions already from
00:06:33.990 || 00:06:34.000 || viewers i wanted to see if we could
00:06:35.909 || 00:06:35.919 || field a few of these right off the top
00:06:38.070 || 00:06:38.080 || um
00:06:41.270 || 00:06:41.280 || first i think uh i think your reputation
00:06:43.029 || 00:06:43.039 || for the drum that you've been beating
00:06:45.510 || 00:06:45.520 || now for well i don't know how many if at
00:06:46.950 || 00:06:46.960 || least two years that i've two and a half
00:06:48.950 || 00:06:48.960 || years that we've worked together um
00:06:51.189 || 00:06:51.199 || is there just keeps being so many things
00:06:53.749 || 00:06:53.759 || that are that are uh coming true on that
00:06:55.350 || 00:06:55.360 || that uh one of the viewers here is
00:06:57.830 || 00:06:57.840 || saying that andy looks like uh moses
00:06:59.270 || 00:06:59.280 || coming down from the from the mountain
00:07:00.790 || 00:07:00.800 || with the tablets that's rob schroeder
00:07:01.830 || 00:07:01.840 || and he started to look like moses when
00:07:02.550 || 00:07:02.560 || he came down the mountain with the
00:07:05.670 || 00:07:05.680 || tablets like uh and it isn't an i told
00:07:07.990 || 00:07:08.000 || you so moment it's a guy's i've been
00:07:10.230 || 00:07:10.240 || trying to share everything that i can
00:07:12.550 || 00:07:12.560 || with you and so i guess if you can come
00:07:14.629 || 00:07:14.639 || from that just for a moment about about
00:07:15.909 || 00:07:15.919 || where you've been coming from and where
00:07:17.990 || 00:07:18.000 || you still are coming from
00:07:21.189 || 00:07:21.199 || yeah i i mean there was a um
00:07:23.110 || 00:07:23.120 || an article that came out the other day
00:07:25.110 || 00:07:25.120 || by a man named sergey
00:07:28.550 || 00:07:28.560 || galazyev uh and he is uh
00:07:30.390 || 00:07:30.400 || involved he's the russian minister in
00:07:32.230 || 00:07:32.240 || charge of um
00:07:34.550 || 00:07:34.560 || uh integration and macroeconomics for
00:07:36.469 || 00:07:36.479 || the eurasian economic union i mean
00:07:38.309 || 00:07:38.319 || basically you're talking the brics
00:07:41.350 || 00:07:41.360 || countries you're you're talking about uh
00:07:43.990 || 00:07:44.000 || this new conglomerate of countries that
00:07:46.790 || 00:07:46.800 || is coalescing against the west and it's
00:07:49.350 || 00:07:49.360 || become more and more and more and more
00:07:52.150 || 00:07:52.160 || obvious and evident to me really that
00:07:54.629 || 00:07:54.639 || this is something a trend that is in
00:07:56.869 || 00:07:56.879 || motion and that is not stopping and he
00:07:58.710 || 00:07:58.720 || came out and said i'm going to read
00:08:00.390 || 00:08:00.400 || something here because i think it's very
00:08:02.469 || 00:08:02.479 || important it really crystallizes and
00:08:04.150 || 00:08:04.160 || undermines everything i've been saying
00:08:06.710 || 00:08:06.720 || to you and that is that he laid out
00:08:08.869 || 00:08:08.879 || fundamental principles upon which the
00:08:10.469 || 00:08:10.479 || new post
00:08:13.430 || 00:08:13.440 || us dollar economic system will be based
00:08:15.589 || 00:08:15.599 || although some common unit will be agreed
00:08:17.749 || 00:08:17.759 || upon it will not be based upon any
00:08:20.150 || 00:08:20.160 || particular currency as with the bretton
00:08:22.950 || 00:08:22.960 || woods order but rather a market basket
00:08:25.350 || 00:08:25.360 || of local currencies tied more deeply to
00:08:27.909 || 00:08:27.919 || an array of real commodities such as
00:08:30.550 || 00:08:30.560 || gold and other precious metals so what
00:08:33.430 || 00:08:33.440 || you are seeing here is
00:08:35.589 || 00:08:35.599 || exactly what i've been talking about a
00:08:38.550 || 00:08:38.560 || coalition of up to 90 percent of human
00:08:41.269 || 00:08:41.279 || population against the west and they are
00:08:44.630 || 00:08:44.640 || going to use i believe the distributed
00:08:46.630 || 00:08:46.640 || ledger technology let's call it a beta
00:08:49.509 || 00:08:49.519 || test of the chinese digital e1 which has
00:08:51.430 || 00:08:51.440 || worked flawlessly for over three years
00:08:53.430 || 00:08:53.440 || to the tune of north of 20 billion
00:08:56.230 || 00:08:56.240 || dollars in successful transactions i
00:08:58.790 || 00:08:58.800 || believe they will use that as the rails
00:09:00.230 || 00:09:00.240 || for the new currency that they've
00:09:02.710 || 00:09:02.720 || already announced the brics nations have
00:09:04.710 || 00:09:04.720 || announced that they will issue a new
00:09:06.389 || 00:09:06.399 || world reserve currency and here you have
00:09:08.949 || 00:09:08.959 || sergey telling us that it's going to be
00:09:11.430 || 00:09:11.440 || pegged to commodities now if you look at
00:09:13.910 || 00:09:13.920 || the european union and ask yourself well
00:09:15.990 || 00:09:16.000 || why did that fail how is this not going
00:09:18.070 || 00:09:18.080 || to fail with all of these countries you
00:09:19.990 || 00:09:20.000 || know one of the things that he talks
00:09:22.870 || 00:09:22.880 || about in this article is this coalition
00:09:25.190 || 00:09:25.200 || of groups even those
00:09:26.870 || 00:09:26.880 || groups that
00:09:27.670 || 00:09:27.680 || have
00:09:29.670 || 00:09:29.680 || feuded for a long time he's talking
00:09:32.870 || 00:09:32.880 || about mending offenses between iran iran
00:09:35.430 || 00:09:35.440 || and saudi arabia he's talking about a
00:09:38.550 || 00:09:38.560 || railway between iran and iraq he's
00:09:40.470 || 00:09:40.480 || talking about all of these countries you
00:09:42.949 || 00:09:42.959 || know the old saying my enemy's enemy is
00:09:44.630 || 00:09:44.640 || my friend
00:09:47.110 || 00:09:47.120 || you're talking about this entire network
00:09:49.590 || 00:09:49.600 || of countries that is standing up to the
00:09:51.990 || 00:09:52.000 || us hegemony and it is becoming more and
00:09:54.790 || 00:09:54.800 || more and more obvious you have this this
00:09:56.870 || 00:09:56.880 || deal called the the i can't even
00:09:58.949 || 00:09:58.959 || pronounce it the tungsi agreement that
00:10:01.030 || 00:10:01.040 || was just signed in april and it's
00:10:03.110 || 00:10:03.120 || between russia china pakistan
00:10:05.750 || 00:10:05.760 || afghanistan iran and several other
00:10:07.590 || 00:10:07.600 || countries that i can hardly pronounce at
00:10:09.829 || 00:10:09.839 || all end and stand you know
00:10:12.070 || 00:10:12.080 || just between iran and afghanistan alone
00:10:14.069 || 00:10:14.079 || do you see what they're doing they are
00:10:16.790 || 00:10:16.800 || coalescing against the west and the
00:10:18.389 || 00:10:18.399 || rallying cry
00:10:20.389 || 00:10:20.399 || of the western hegemony the hip the
00:10:23.670 || 00:10:23.680 || hypocrisy of the west the the the the
00:10:26.150 || 00:10:26.160 || tyranny of the west is what they're all
00:10:27.750 || 00:10:27.760 || coalescing
00:10:28.710 || 00:10:28.720 || um
00:10:31.430 || 00:10:31.440 || together upon and it's becoming more and
00:10:34.150 || 00:10:34.160 || more and more and more obvious to me
00:10:37.829 || 00:10:37.839 || day by day by day and you know i think
00:10:39.590 || 00:10:39.600 || that is where i'm coming from i think
00:10:40.870 || 00:10:40.880 || that the fed
00:10:42.550 || 00:10:42.560 || and and the
00:10:43.350 || 00:10:43.360 || the
00:10:46.389 || 00:10:46.399 || talk of of a hundred basis point rise in
00:10:48.630 || 00:10:48.640 || rates is just a whole bunch of sideshow
00:10:51.030 || 00:10:51.040 || nonsense i really truly do believe that
00:10:53.590 || 00:10:53.600 || then again i think that the real
00:10:55.670 || 00:10:55.680 || target what everyone needs to keep their
00:10:58.470 || 00:10:58.480 || eyes on is indeed this coalition of
00:10:59.590 || 00:10:59.600 || countries
00:11:03.030 || 00:11:03.040 || that is lining up against the western uh
00:11:05.670 || 00:11:05.680 || hegemony and i think the
00:11:09.190 || 00:11:09.200 || the hatred and of the west and maybe
00:11:11.829 || 00:11:11.839 || that's a strong statement maybe it's not
00:11:13.110 || 00:11:13.120 || uh is
00:11:14.790 || 00:11:14.800 || is more
00:11:17.190 || 00:11:17.200 || cohesive to this group
00:11:18.870 || 00:11:18.880 || um than
00:11:20.030 || 00:11:20.040 || than
00:11:21.670 || 00:11:21.680 || centuries-old
00:11:23.910 || 00:11:23.920 || feuding and i think that's an
00:11:26.470 || 00:11:26.480 || interesting thing now the european union
00:11:28.630 || 00:11:28.640 || failed because
00:11:29.990 || 00:11:30.000 || you know there are a lot of countries in
00:11:32.069 || 00:11:32.079 || the union or parts part of the reason
00:11:33.910 || 00:11:33.920 || it's failing is because there are
00:11:35.430 || 00:11:35.440 || countries that don't pull their weight
00:11:37.509 || 00:11:37.519 || some in the west do more than some in
00:11:40.630 || 00:11:40.640 || the east and vice versa but as sergey
00:11:43.190 || 00:11:43.200 || pointed out this is not going to be
00:11:45.350 || 00:11:45.360 || anything like what the bretton woods
00:11:46.949 || 00:11:46.959 || agreement was or anything like what
00:11:48.470 || 00:11:48.480 || we've seen the european union this is
00:11:51.030 || 00:11:51.040 || going to be based upon commodities and i
00:11:53.110 || 00:11:53.120 || think it will be pegged to a distributed
00:11:55.269 || 00:11:55.279 || ledger that the chinese will roll out
00:11:56.630 || 00:11:56.640 || and back
00:11:58.710 || 00:11:58.720 || citing the successful beta test of the
00:12:00.470 || 00:12:00.480 || last three years even in the winter
00:12:02.550 || 00:12:02.560 || olympics you had to use your your cell
00:12:04.230 || 00:12:04.240 || phone and it was the digital yuan that
00:12:06.710 || 00:12:06.720 || you were using so they will use that
00:12:08.069 || 00:12:08.079 || successful
00:12:10.550 || 00:12:10.560 || beta test if you will as the rails and
00:12:12.949 || 00:12:12.959 || the backbone of a new currency to which
00:12:14.790 || 00:12:14.800 || they've all announced and sergey here
00:12:16.710 || 00:12:16.720 || who's really in charge of putting this
00:12:18.710 || 00:12:18.720 || all together in many respects or part of
00:12:19.430 || 00:12:19.440 || the
00:12:21.910 || 00:12:21.920 || the group that's putting it together is
00:12:24.389 || 00:12:24.399 || saying that you know
00:12:26.230 || 00:12:26.240 || this is going to be backed upon or
00:12:28.949 || 00:12:28.959 || backed by commodities and i think really
00:12:31.670 || 00:12:31.680 || that's the issue here is that you know
00:12:33.990 || 00:12:34.000 || gold and silver and all of these things
00:12:35.670 || 00:12:35.680 || that that these countries are
00:12:38.230 || 00:12:38.240 || accumulating in mass and i say silver
00:12:39.990 || 00:12:40.000 || look at the indian import numbers are
00:12:42.150 || 00:12:42.160 || off the charts but look at the amount of
00:12:43.670 || 00:12:43.680 || gold all of these countries are
00:12:45.990 || 00:12:46.000 || accumulating and it is going to be
00:12:48.230 || 00:12:48.240 || pegged to a new
00:12:50.470 || 00:12:50.480 || uh i believe to a new distributed ledger
00:12:52.870 || 00:12:52.880 || technology that um
00:12:54.550 || 00:12:54.560 || every single day we see articles that
00:12:56.150 || 00:12:56.160 || make me believe more and more and more
00:12:57.829 || 00:12:57.839 || and more that this is the path that we
00:12:58.790 || 00:12:58.800 || are on
00:13:02.069 || 00:13:02.079 || and then you throw in the new uh russian
00:13:05.590 || 00:13:05.600 || uh platform that is being proposed for
00:13:07.269 || 00:13:07.279 || precious metals for pricing precious
00:13:10.870 || 00:13:10.880 || metals which to their um own admission
00:13:13.269 || 00:13:13.279 || would be to break the
00:13:15.829 || 00:13:15.839 || the grip that and the manipulation of
00:13:17.990 || 00:13:18.000 || the western markets both the lme and the
00:13:20.150 || 00:13:20.160 || cobanks now you put all of that in
00:13:21.990 || 00:13:22.000 || context as we've been talking about this
00:13:24.550 || 00:13:24.560 || over and over and over and over again
00:13:27.190 || 00:13:27.200 || really for the last few years and the
00:13:29.350 || 00:13:29.360 || interesting thing is that every saturday
00:13:31.269 || 00:13:31.279 || or sunday when i start preparing for the
00:13:33.350 || 00:13:33.360 || next week
00:13:35.990 || 00:13:36.000 || conversations there's another story and
00:13:37.990 || 00:13:38.000 || another story and another story that
00:13:41.030 || 00:13:41.040 || fits this progression of events you put
00:13:43.110 || 00:13:43.120 || all of that together and you look what's
00:13:44.710 || 00:13:44.720 || happening right now on the exchanges
00:13:46.629 || 00:13:46.639 || around the world whether it be the lme
00:13:48.870 || 00:13:48.880 || which has the lowest amount of silver
00:13:51.190 || 00:13:51.200 || held on it in the history of it really i
00:13:53.430 || 00:13:53.440 || mean they're draining the lme they're
00:13:56.389 || 00:13:56.399 || draining the comex they're draining all
00:13:58.710 || 00:13:58.720 || of the exchanges over a hundred million
00:14:00.790 || 00:14:00.800 || ounces pulled out of slv in the last
00:14:04.069 || 00:14:04.079 || four months uh massive drawdowns in gold
00:14:06.470 || 00:14:06.480 || and silver on both exchanges the london
00:14:08.949 || 00:14:08.959 || metals exchange and the comex
00:14:11.110 || 00:14:11.120 || and then you see the commercial banks
00:14:14.150 || 00:14:14.160 || for the very first time i have ever seen
00:14:16.949 || 00:14:16.959 || in 33 years are net long and silver they
00:14:19.189 || 00:14:19.199 || are net long over 5 000 contracts like
00:14:20.629 || 00:14:20.639 || 5100
00:14:22.310 || 00:14:22.320 || contracts now if you
00:14:25.590 || 00:14:25.600 || just look at the banks themselves
00:14:27.189 || 00:14:27.199 || not so one of the things in the
00:14:28.710 || 00:14:28.720 || commitment of traders report is that the
00:14:31.829 || 00:14:31.839 || commercials are lumped in the banks are
00:14:33.910 || 00:14:33.920 || lumped in with the producers and the
00:14:35.990 || 00:14:36.000 || producers are the ones that legitimately
00:14:38.069 || 00:14:38.079 || hedge the producers and the companies
00:14:39.829 || 00:14:39.839 || like myself who use the comex to
00:14:42.150 || 00:14:42.160 || legitimately hedge they're lumped into
00:14:44.389 || 00:14:44.399 || the commercials because a commercial is
00:14:46.710 || 00:14:46.720 || a non-commercialist someone who has no
00:14:49.110 || 00:14:49.120 || interest in hedging or or protecting
00:14:50.790 || 00:14:50.800 || against price swings they're just doing
00:14:52.150 || 00:14:52.160 || it for
00:14:54.629 || 00:14:54.639 || investment and speculation so if you
00:14:56.629 || 00:14:56.639 || just look at the banks and not the
00:14:59.670 || 00:14:59.680 || producers those numbers are much greater
00:15:01.750 || 00:15:01.760 || the commercial banks which i will tell
00:15:03.670 || 00:15:03.680 || you are the most sophisticated
00:15:05.509 || 00:15:05.519 || well-funded well-informed traders on the
00:15:08.389 || 00:15:08.399 || globe are going really long and we
00:15:10.150 || 00:15:10.160 || talked about this a couple weeks ago
00:15:12.550 || 00:15:12.560 || that i believe they set a bear trap for
00:15:15.110 || 00:15:15.120 || the hedge funds who are massively short
00:15:17.189 || 00:15:17.199 || and getting shorter and when they go
00:15:19.829 || 00:15:19.839 || short and when they sell their longs
00:15:21.590 || 00:15:21.600 || the commercial banks take the other side
00:15:23.990 || 00:15:24.000 || of it you put all of this together you
00:15:26.790 || 00:15:26.800 || see a dedolorization a growing
00:15:29.430 || 00:15:29.440 || devalorization unions that are being
00:15:32.389 || 00:15:32.399 || made usurping the dollar coalescing
00:15:33.990 || 00:15:34.000 || against the west and the western
00:15:36.629 || 00:15:36.639 || hegemony and the perceived hypocrisy of
00:15:38.150 || 00:15:38.160 || the west and i can see why they would
00:15:39.670 || 00:15:39.680 || think that about us
00:15:41.430 || 00:15:41.440 || and they are using that as a rallying
00:15:43.590 || 00:15:43.600 || cry at the same time you were seeing
00:15:45.670 || 00:15:45.680 || record imports by the commercial banks
00:15:48.310 || 00:15:48.320 || record drawdowns on all of the exchanges
00:15:50.389 || 00:15:50.399 || and now the commercial banks
00:15:52.710 || 00:15:52.720 || who always win the war
00:15:56.870 || 00:15:56.880 || are going that long something is coming
00:15:59.110 || 00:15:59.120 || down the road and it's bigger than than
00:16:00.870 || 00:16:00.880 || than anything we've seen in a long time
00:16:02.949 || 00:16:02.959 || don't know what don't know when but you
00:16:04.470 || 00:16:04.480 || can see by the positioning of the
00:16:06.069 || 00:16:06.079 || biggest money in the world that they are
00:16:07.269 || 00:16:07.279 || expecting
00:16:09.430 || 00:16:09.440 || something to come here pretty soon
00:16:11.269 || 00:16:11.279 || yeah you mentioned uh several times
00:16:13.509 || 00:16:13.519 || during that uh section when you talked
00:16:14.870 || 00:16:14.880 || about the
00:16:17.110 || 00:16:17.120 || the medium of exchange needing to be
00:16:19.110 || 00:16:19.120 || based on commodities and the countries
00:16:22.230 || 00:16:22.240 || that are that are coalescing to to agree
00:16:24.790 || 00:16:24.800 || on that are producers and when i
00:16:26.389 || 00:16:26.399 || interviewed bill holter just a few days
00:16:28.310 || 00:16:28.320 || ago he talked about that he said this
00:16:30.069 || 00:16:30.079 || has gone on too long
00:16:32.389 || 00:16:32.399 || with the west that's pretty much the
00:16:36.230 || 00:16:36.240 || united states and europe uh basically uh
00:16:38.470 || 00:16:38.480 || outsourcing all of their manufacturing
00:16:39.269 || 00:16:39.279 || to
00:16:42.550 || 00:16:42.560 || asia and and other countries and then uh
00:16:43.749 || 00:16:43.759 || sending them
00:16:45.509 || 00:16:45.519 || dollars
00:16:47.749 || 00:16:47.759 || in exchange for real things
00:16:49.509 || 00:16:49.519 || and so we end up with a bunch of
00:16:51.910 || 00:16:51.920 || consumer goods which are all now expired
00:16:54.470 || 00:16:54.480 || and you know thrown in the landfill and
00:16:56.790 || 00:16:56.800 || they have all these trillions of dollars
00:16:59.430 || 00:16:59.440 || and now we're seeing uh
00:17:02.550 || 00:17:02.560 || they've been using this opportunity of
00:17:04.309 || 00:17:04.319 || low prices and precious metals to
00:17:05.990 || 00:17:06.000 || accumulate those but they've also been
00:17:08.470 || 00:17:08.480 || purchasing up things like real estate
00:17:10.630 || 00:17:10.640 || and farms and ranch land and everything
00:17:11.909 || 00:17:11.919 || in the u.s so
00:17:14.069 || 00:17:14.079 || it's it seems uh
00:17:16.870 || 00:17:16.880 || almost cruelly poetic justice when you
00:17:18.630 || 00:17:18.640 || have a country like china that takes
00:17:20.710 || 00:17:20.720 || these long-term views of things a
00:17:22.150 || 00:17:22.160 || hundred year plan rather than the you
00:17:24.230 || 00:17:24.240 || know three months plan to take all those
00:17:26.309 || 00:17:26.319 || paper dollars turn around and buy out
00:17:28.230 || 00:17:28.240 || the land from underneath our feet uh
00:17:29.750 || 00:17:29.760 || there was there's quite a debate raging
00:17:31.029 || 00:17:31.039 || in some states about whether that should
00:17:32.390 || 00:17:32.400 || be permitted enough but so far it is
00:17:34.470 || 00:17:34.480 || being permitted and
00:17:36.549 || 00:17:36.559 || that's that that principle that you
00:17:38.549 || 00:17:38.559 || talked about of the countries that are
00:17:40.870 || 00:17:40.880 || coalescing in the east
00:17:42.950 || 00:17:42.960 || are producers they they have natural
00:17:45.029 || 00:17:45.039 || resources they manufacture things they
00:17:47.110 || 00:17:47.120 || produce things they've got strategic
00:17:49.029 || 00:17:49.039 || commodities that the world cannot live
00:17:51.270 || 00:17:51.280 || without and you've got
00:17:53.190 || 00:17:53.200 || europe and the us just taking these
00:17:54.789 || 00:17:54.799 || ideological stances about how we're
00:17:56.950 || 00:17:56.960 || going to put price caps on
00:17:58.950 || 00:17:58.960 || on natural gas from russia and we're
00:18:02.070 || 00:18:02.080 || gonna do all this stuff and and um
00:18:04.310 || 00:18:04.320 || using the might of the last
00:18:07.190 || 00:18:07.200 || you know the the bretton woods dollar uh
00:18:08.549 || 00:18:08.559 || we've gotten used to being able to just
00:18:09.990 || 00:18:10.000 || say things like that and get away with
00:18:12.150 || 00:18:12.160 || it sounds like in your view those days
00:18:14.310 || 00:18:14.320 || are coming to an end yeah very much so i
00:18:16.150 || 00:18:16.160 || look at
00:18:17.750 || 00:18:17.760 || look at the term the fallacy of
00:18:19.909 || 00:18:19.919 || composition where you know whether
00:18:21.430 || 00:18:21.440 || you're talking about all the pieces that
00:18:23.190 || 00:18:23.200 || i continue to put together in and of
00:18:25.350 || 00:18:25.360 || themselves whether it be tier one
00:18:26.870 || 00:18:26.880 || revision and gold
00:18:30.630 || 00:18:30.640 || accumulation by the central banks uh um
00:18:32.870 || 00:18:32.880 || accumulation by the commercial banks mit
00:18:35.270 || 00:18:35.280 || all of the the the items that you talk
00:18:37.190 || 00:18:37.200 || about in and of themselves okay whatever
00:18:39.190 || 00:18:39.200 || but you put them all together and they
00:18:41.590 || 00:18:41.600 || have a much greater meaning and look at
00:18:43.590 || 00:18:43.600 || the main argument you get from people
00:18:45.990 || 00:18:46.000 || about this ideology that i have this
00:18:48.390 || 00:18:48.400 || thought process i have is well you know
00:18:50.310 || 00:18:50.320 || you know the dollar is the best currency
00:18:52.230 || 00:18:52.240 || there isn't an economy that is better in
00:18:54.630 || 00:18:54.640 || it okay i agree it's the prettiest horse
00:18:56.710 || 00:18:56.720 || in this la in the slaughterhouse okay
00:18:59.830 || 00:18:59.840 || fine uh you talk about military might
00:19:01.510 || 00:19:01.520 || yeah we're the strongest military in the
00:19:03.669 || 00:19:03.679 || world but look at the coalescion of all
00:19:05.270 || 00:19:05.280 || of these countries and now you're
00:19:07.110 || 00:19:07.120 || beginning to see our allies sign up with
00:19:08.950 || 00:19:08.960 || the bricks including egypt and turkey
00:19:11.029 || 00:19:11.039 || and mexico is signing up to it how about
00:19:12.470 || 00:19:12.480 || the fact that you know we've talked
00:19:15.510 || 00:19:15.520 || about this all of the the opec producing
00:19:16.950 || 00:19:16.960 || countries every one of them are in the
00:19:20.070 || 00:19:20.080 || belt road initiative six of the seven of
00:19:22.950 || 00:19:22.960 || the opec countries are in the brics and
00:19:25.430 || 00:19:25.440 || or signing up for the seventh united
00:19:26.950 || 00:19:26.960 || arab emirates just signed up with the
00:19:29.430 || 00:19:29.440 || brics banks all of these countries
00:19:31.830 || 00:19:31.840 || together whether you're talking military
00:19:33.669 || 00:19:33.679 || whether you're talking gdp whether
00:19:36.789 || 00:19:36.799 || you're talking an economy all of it
00:19:39.190 || 00:19:39.200 || are stronger than the west and all of
00:19:42.950 || 00:19:42.960 || those countries uh if if properly
00:19:44.150 || 00:19:44.160 || harvested
00:19:46.870 || 00:19:46.880 || amongst themselves um are backed by
00:19:49.029 || 00:19:49.039 || commodities and where the west is all
00:19:51.510 || 00:19:51.520 || about dead instruments and
00:19:53.909 || 00:19:53.919 || and really nothing substantial backing
00:19:56.390 || 00:19:56.400 || it so yeah i think this is a trend in
00:19:58.310 || 00:19:58.320 || motion and it's interesting you're
00:19:59.830 || 00:19:59.840 || beginning to see a lot of people talk
00:20:01.990 || 00:20:02.000 || about it now and no one was talking
00:20:03.350 || 00:20:03.360 || about it when you and i were talking
00:20:05.190 || 00:20:05.200 || about it over a year ago and now
00:20:06.870 || 00:20:06.880 || everyone's talking about it and quite
00:20:09.350 || 00:20:09.360 || eloquently guys like alistair mcleod you
00:20:10.789 || 00:20:10.799 || know they're talking about it and it's
00:20:13.270 || 00:20:13.280 || becoming more and more and more obvious
00:20:15.350 || 00:20:15.360 || to everyone i don't know why this was so
00:20:18.870 || 00:20:18.880 || obvious to me i don't know um but it has
00:20:21.990 || 00:20:22.000 || been and um i just maybe it's because
00:20:24.310 || 00:20:24.320 || i've been looking down this thread maybe
00:20:26.230 || 00:20:26.240 || i got lucky when i realized why the hell
00:20:27.990 || 00:20:28.000 || are they reclassifying gold tier one
00:20:30.789 || 00:20:30.799 || what the heck is this all about um and
00:20:32.710 || 00:20:32.720 || seeing why are the banks repatriating
00:20:34.870 || 00:20:34.880 || their gold the central banks and putting
00:20:36.710 || 00:20:36.720 || these threads together and following
00:20:38.390 || 00:20:38.400 || that threat oh wait here's another piece
00:20:40.390 || 00:20:40.400 || and another piece another piece
00:20:42.870 || 00:20:42.880 || and when you lose the petrol reserve
00:20:45.669 || 00:20:45.679 || standard um which i believe we will when
00:20:48.549 || 00:20:48.559 || you see opec or saudi arabia
00:20:49.669 || 00:20:49.679 || joining
00:20:50.870 || 00:20:50.880 || uh
00:20:52.390 || 00:20:52.400 || the brics nations
00:20:54.549 || 00:20:54.559 || when you see every opec country on the
00:20:56.549 || 00:20:56.559 || belt road initiative and we are not part
00:20:58.870 || 00:20:58.880 || of it you see this expansion and they're
00:21:00.830 || 00:21:00.840 || now expanding into countries like
00:21:02.870 || 00:21:02.880 || afghanistan uh they're expanding into
00:21:05.029 || 00:21:05.039 || countries that that hate the west and
00:21:07.669 || 00:21:07.679 || they will use this rallying cry and this
00:21:10.630 || 00:21:10.640 || this cohesiveness to build
00:21:11.990 || 00:21:12.000 || um
00:21:13.590 || 00:21:13.600 || an infrastructure that is going to be
00:21:15.510 || 00:21:15.520 || very very hard to challenge on every
00:21:17.350 || 00:21:17.360 || single level i'm very concerned and i
00:21:19.669 || 00:21:19.679 || think everyone should be as well i
00:21:22.470 || 00:21:22.480 || really truly do the west has
00:21:24.470 || 00:21:24.480 || i think um
00:21:26.950 || 00:21:26.960 || is very close to
00:21:31.029 || 00:21:31.039 || um its final chapters in its historic
00:21:33.110 || 00:21:33.120 || dominance for centuries and it's now
00:21:35.350 || 00:21:35.360 || moving eastward most of those countries
00:21:36.470 || 00:21:36.480 || were
00:21:38.470 || 00:21:38.480 || third world countries for you know for
00:21:39.990 || 00:21:40.000 || the last hundred plus years and now all
00:21:41.830 || 00:21:41.840 || of a sudden they are they are gaining
00:21:43.430 || 00:21:43.440 || strength in military strength and
00:21:46.390 || 00:21:46.400 || economy and most importantly strength in
00:21:49.270 || 00:21:49.280 || unity and they are i think going to be a
00:21:52.310 || 00:21:52.320 || formidable foe and
00:21:53.669 || 00:21:53.679 || you know this is the thread that i've
00:21:55.669 || 00:21:55.679 || been following and i have
00:21:57.590 || 00:21:57.600 || never been more convinced that this is
00:22:01.590 || 00:22:01.600 || the path that we unfortunately are on
00:22:04.310 || 00:22:04.320 || in addition to the humanitarian crisis
00:22:06.549 || 00:22:06.559 || that could come from energy
00:22:09.990 || 00:22:10.000 || shortages this winter for example in
00:22:12.549 || 00:22:12.559 || europe for one uh there's also been talk
00:22:13.750 || 00:22:13.760 || about whether
00:22:15.510 || 00:22:15.520 || an energy crunch in europe for example
00:22:17.750 || 00:22:17.760 || the spiking uh electric prices that have
00:22:19.669 || 00:22:19.679 || caused shutdowns of some major steel
00:22:21.029 || 00:22:21.039 || plants that sort of thing because
00:22:22.549 || 00:22:22.559 || they're not economically viable with
00:22:24.230 || 00:22:24.240 || these multiples of
00:22:26.149 || 00:22:26.159 || normal energy prices whether that will
00:22:29.510 || 00:22:29.520 || also impact uh smelting refining that
00:22:31.430 || 00:22:31.440 || sort of thing for precious metals do you
00:22:33.110 || 00:22:33.120 || have any insights just as we found
00:22:35.029 || 00:22:35.039 || during covid there was one point i think
00:22:37.270 || 00:22:37.280 || when all the swiss refiners were offline
00:22:38.870 || 00:22:38.880 || at the same time we had coveted
00:22:41.029 || 00:22:41.039 || shutdowns of multiple mints that sort of
00:22:42.390 || 00:22:42.400 || thing it really disrupted the
00:22:43.990 || 00:22:44.000 || availability of
00:22:46.630 || 00:22:46.640 || precious metals do you have any
00:22:49.909 || 00:22:49.919 || uh discussions or have seen any uh
00:22:51.510 || 00:22:51.520 || information that would lead us to think
00:22:53.270 || 00:22:53.280 || that the spiking energy prices are going
00:22:55.510 || 00:22:55.520 || to be yet another uh
00:22:57.590 || 00:22:57.600 || cause for disruptions in availability of
00:22:59.350 || 00:22:59.360 || precious metals no i haven't but it
00:23:01.669 || 00:23:01.679 || makes sense and whether it be a spike in
00:23:03.270 || 00:23:03.280 || energy costs more money to pull it out
00:23:05.750 || 00:23:05.760 || of the ground uh or a spike in energy
00:23:07.430 || 00:23:07.440 || when you're talking about the inability
00:23:10.549 || 00:23:10.559 || to you know to efficiently uh refine it
00:23:13.430 || 00:23:13.440 || and produce it i have and it makes sense
00:23:15.830 || 00:23:15.840 || um but you know like we talked about on
00:23:17.590 || 00:23:17.600 || on our our
00:23:19.669 || 00:23:19.679 || market update the other day
00:23:22.310 || 00:23:22.320 || the impromptu one there are so many
00:23:24.070 || 00:23:24.080 || things that just pop up you know
00:23:25.750 || 00:23:25.760 || everything that i talk about is really
00:23:29.029 || 00:23:29.039 || macro in scale when i talk about the
00:23:30.149 || 00:23:30.159 || the
00:23:32.070 || 00:23:32.080 || product disappearing ultimately a market
00:23:33.750 || 00:23:33.760 || defined by the inability to source
00:23:35.750 || 00:23:35.760 || product as i always say on your show i'm
00:23:37.590 || 00:23:37.600 || thinking i'm following rick rule's logic
00:23:39.830 || 00:23:39.840 || in that in that one half of one percent
00:23:41.510 || 00:23:41.520 || allocation to metals across the whole
00:23:43.830 || 00:23:43.840 || financial matrix in this country
00:23:46.390 || 00:23:46.400 || when that becomes five percent
00:23:47.830 || 00:23:47.840 || it's going to be impossible to get
00:23:49.590 || 00:23:49.600 || product that's a ten-fold increase in
00:23:52.070 || 00:23:52.080 || this industry cannot handle it so that's
00:23:53.590 || 00:23:53.600 || what i'm thinking but look at the micro
00:23:55.350 || 00:23:55.360 || side of things queen elizabeth dies and
00:23:56.870 || 00:23:56.880 || everything goes way up in prices
00:23:58.630 || 00:23:58.640 || becoming harder to get
00:23:59.750 || 00:23:59.760 || something
00:24:01.750 || 00:24:01.760 || like that that no one would think about
00:24:03.430 || 00:24:03.440 || that would change the dynamics of the
00:24:05.830 || 00:24:05.840 || market will happen and so look supply
00:24:07.830 || 00:24:07.840 || chain problems are are probably only
00:24:10.149 || 00:24:10.159 || going to get much worse and
00:24:14.310 || 00:24:14.320 || i you know look at one of these times we
00:24:16.870 || 00:24:16.880 || see a market really sell off
00:24:18.390 || 00:24:18.400 || you know you've had a federal reserve
00:24:20.310 || 00:24:20.320 || that has come in every time the market
00:24:22.390 || 00:24:22.400 || should have cleansed itself like a
00:24:24.549 || 00:24:24.559 || forest fire but instead we come in and
00:24:27.190 || 00:24:27.200 || put out that fire and the fed does and
00:24:28.950 || 00:24:28.960 || has created a greater and greater
00:24:31.430 || 00:24:31.440 || greater distortions one of these days
00:24:33.430 || 00:24:33.440 || and maybe this is the beginning of it
00:24:35.510 || 00:24:35.520 || you see a market sell-off a real one
00:24:37.350 || 00:24:37.360 || that'll wake people up shake them to the
00:24:39.110 || 00:24:39.120 || core they've already looked at their
00:24:41.269 || 00:24:41.279 || 401ks are down considerably over the
00:24:43.190 || 00:24:43.200 || last several months but it'll really
00:24:45.669 || 00:24:45.679 || shake them you know a bear market often
00:24:47.750 || 00:24:47.760 || will bleed little by little by little by
00:24:49.350 || 00:24:49.360 || little and they'll be bear market
00:24:50.630 || 00:24:50.640 || rallies they don't bleed and they'll
00:24:52.070 || 00:24:52.080 || bleed and they'll bleed them rally will
00:24:54.070 || 00:24:54.080 || suck you back in okay it's all over get
00:24:55.669 || 00:24:55.679 || back in it's all good and then it'll
00:24:57.269 || 00:24:57.279 || fall some more then bang it's gonna fall
00:24:59.510 || 00:24:59.520 || really hard and that's
00:25:01.190 || 00:25:01.200 || the kind of thing that'll wake up the
00:25:04.149 || 00:25:04.159 || public and when the public awakens
00:25:05.669 || 00:25:05.679 || where do you go
00:25:08.070 || 00:25:08.080 || i mean where do you go and you know
00:25:09.430 || 00:25:09.440 || people are saying well you can buy you
00:25:11.269 || 00:25:11.279 || know one year treasury earning three
00:25:12.870 || 00:25:12.880 || percent great well you're gonna lose
00:25:14.549 || 00:25:14.559 || five percent purchasing power it's not a
00:25:17.190 || 00:25:17.200 || good investment where do you go do you
00:25:19.590 || 00:25:19.600 || you know and i think that that's the
00:25:21.190 || 00:25:21.200 || real issue here is that all of these
00:25:24.390 || 00:25:24.400 || assets not only haven't blown sky high
00:25:28.470 || 00:25:28.480 || in a make-believe monetary environment
00:25:30.470 || 00:25:30.480 || but they're all inversely correlated to
00:25:32.549 || 00:25:32.559 || a rise in rates and that's the thing
00:25:35.590 || 00:25:35.600 || people need to understand and if these
00:25:37.830 || 00:25:37.840 || things happen where the east
00:25:40.710 || 00:25:40.720 || starts to forsake the dollar look at all
00:25:42.710 || 00:25:42.720 || of the agreements that have been struck
00:25:44.710 || 00:25:44.720 || across the globe that no longer use
00:25:45.669 || 00:25:45.679 || dollars
00:25:47.430 || 00:25:47.440 || like from india where their largest
00:25:49.269 || 00:25:49.279 || trading partner now they're using rupee
00:25:51.430 || 00:25:51.440 || for domestic and international trades
00:25:53.430 || 00:25:53.440 || all of these trades between countries
00:25:55.190 || 00:25:55.200 || that used to settle for energy and
00:25:57.590 || 00:25:57.600 || dollars are no longer settling in
00:26:00.390 || 00:26:00.400 || dollars they're settling amongst multi
00:26:03.750 || 00:26:03.760 || uh and unilateral agreements forsaking
00:26:05.830 || 00:26:05.840 || the dollar but if that one switch
00:26:07.990 || 00:26:08.000 || happens where opec says hey it's been
00:26:10.310 || 00:26:10.320 || great but we're now part of the brics
00:26:11.909 || 00:26:11.919 || nations we're part of the belt road
00:26:14.950 || 00:26:14.960 || initiative this represents 90 of human
00:26:16.710 || 00:26:16.720 || population and we're going to open up
00:26:19.110 || 00:26:19.120 || oil purchases to other currencies maybe
00:26:20.310 || 00:26:20.320 || currencies that are backed by
00:26:23.350 || 00:26:23.360 || commodities not that are inflating away
00:26:26.149 || 00:26:26.159 || the value of the currency and we're
00:26:27.590 || 00:26:27.600 || gonna we're gonna move in that direction
00:26:29.909 || 00:26:29.919 || thanks a lot and when that happens and
00:26:31.590 || 00:26:31.600 || those dollars get dumped and interest
00:26:33.269 || 00:26:33.279 || rates spike
00:26:35.190 || 00:26:35.200 || that'll really wake up the public and
00:26:37.510 || 00:26:37.520 || that'll be an awful experience but where
00:26:38.870 || 00:26:38.880 || do you go
00:26:40.789 || 00:26:40.799 || and so farmland yeah why do you think
00:26:42.549 || 00:26:42.559 || bill gates and the chinese are buying it
00:26:44.310 || 00:26:44.320 || might be the only other place that i
00:26:46.070 || 00:26:46.080 || would put my money right now than
00:26:48.149 || 00:26:48.159 || precious metals and who's buying all the
00:26:50.310 || 00:26:50.320 || precious metals oh yeah it's the chinese
00:26:51.590 || 00:26:51.600 || so
00:26:52.950 || 00:26:52.960 || the biggest money in the world the
00:26:55.350 || 00:26:55.360 || people who are thinking long term
00:26:56.950 || 00:26:56.960 || the people who are playing chess not
00:26:58.630 || 00:26:58.640 || checkers like we are
00:27:00.870 || 00:27:00.880 || they are positioning they're positioning
00:27:03.029 || 00:27:03.039 || themselves for this event
00:27:04.070 || 00:27:04.080 || and
00:27:06.549 || 00:27:06.559 || most people here don't have a clue
00:27:08.870 || 00:27:08.880 || partially because our media is pathetic
00:27:10.549 || 00:27:10.559 || and our media doesn't tell us anything
00:27:12.789 || 00:27:12.799 || that's really important every time i
00:27:14.789 || 00:27:14.799 || give this speech that i've been giving
00:27:17.350 || 00:27:17.360 || lately at conferences or i just did one
00:27:19.510 || 00:27:19.520 || in south dakota similar to the one that
00:27:21.590 || 00:27:21.600 || i gave it at the rick rules event that
00:27:22.630 || 00:27:22.640 || you saw
00:27:24.310 || 00:27:24.320 || i started out by saying look there are
00:27:25.990 || 00:27:26.000 || five mile posts here that i'm going to
00:27:27.669 || 00:27:27.679 || talk about all of which i've talked on
00:27:29.750 || 00:27:29.760 || your show and i want you to think how
00:27:31.750 || 00:27:31.760 || many of you know this how many of you
00:27:34.149 || 00:27:34.159 || even heard of it no one knows gold was
00:27:36.710 || 00:27:36.720 || reclassified tier one nobody knows about
00:27:39.190 || 00:27:39.200 || the belt road initiative no one hardly
00:27:40.549 || 00:27:40.559 || even knows what makes the dollar the
00:27:43.590 || 00:27:43.600 || world reserve currency few people if any
00:27:46.549 || 00:27:46.559 || know that saudi arabia has has expressed
00:27:48.230 || 00:27:48.240 || interest and more or less already
00:27:50.630 || 00:27:50.640 || acquiesced to joining the brics nations
00:27:52.789 || 00:27:52.799 || all of these things that are happening
00:27:55.190 || 00:27:55.200 || that will have profound effects
00:27:57.750 || 00:27:57.760 || on our lives and especially on our
00:27:59.669 || 00:27:59.679 || children's lives
00:28:01.190 || 00:28:01.200 || are really widely
00:28:04.870 || 00:28:04.880 || completely unknown in this country
00:28:06.789 || 00:28:06.799 || most people can't write a check for five
00:28:10.470 || 00:28:10.480 || grand to pay for a root canal or or a
00:28:12.950 || 00:28:12.960 || blown out tire most people are living
00:28:15.269 || 00:28:15.279 || paycheck to paycheck and with inflation
00:28:17.350 || 00:28:17.360 || running at 40-year highs most people are
00:28:20.389 || 00:28:20.399 || being bled dry of their savings
00:28:22.070 || 00:28:22.080 || we are not prepared for what's coming
00:28:25.510 || 00:28:25.520 || down the pike done again and
00:28:27.909 || 00:28:27.919 || you know every single day i get more and
00:28:29.909 || 00:28:29.919 || more convinced this is happening and
00:28:32.870 || 00:28:32.880 || it's a it's a curse it's a curse because
00:28:35.669 || 00:28:35.679 || i want to help people and
00:28:37.909 || 00:28:37.919 || you know it's cathartic to come and talk
00:28:39.750 || 00:28:39.760 || to you and the people who watch your
00:28:42.310 || 00:28:42.320 || show who understand this and prepare you
00:28:43.990 || 00:28:44.000 || but they have the same curse that you
00:28:46.310 || 00:28:46.320 || and i do and that is trying to help your
00:28:49.190 || 00:28:49.200 || friends trying to help your family uh is
00:28:51.669 || 00:28:51.679 || a is is a awful experience they think
00:28:53.590 || 00:28:53.600 || you're a nut job they think you're crazy
00:28:56.149 || 00:28:56.159 || why would i do this they just laugh
00:28:57.190 || 00:28:57.200 || um
00:28:59.190 || 00:28:59.200 || and when it happens
00:29:00.230 || 00:29:00.240 || um
00:29:02.070 || 00:29:02.080 || it's it's not going to be something that
00:29:04.470 || 00:29:04.480 || i will take any any delight and like you
00:29:06.070 || 00:29:06.080 || said it's not going to be i told you so
00:29:09.029 || 00:29:09.039 || moment um but it's happening and i think
00:29:10.549 || 00:29:10.559 || people need to wake up because it's
00:29:13.590 || 00:29:13.600 || really happening and it's it's actually
00:29:15.430 || 00:29:15.440 || increasing in speed and it was the
00:29:17.430 || 00:29:17.440 || weaponizing of the dollar that i think
00:29:20.789 || 00:29:20.799 || put this in to overdrive and i ask
00:29:22.870 || 00:29:22.880 || people this question all the time if the
00:29:25.510 || 00:29:25.520 || united states was russia and mexico was
00:29:27.430 || 00:29:27.440 || the ukraine and we were in a war with
00:29:30.149 || 00:29:30.159 || mexico and russia provided 90 billion
00:29:32.549 || 00:29:32.559 || dollars stinger missiles and drones and
00:29:35.029 || 00:29:35.039 || intelligence on where to drop the bombs
00:29:36.870 || 00:29:36.880 || and then froze our assets and kicked us
00:29:38.789 || 00:29:38.799 || out of the international swift system is
00:29:41.110 || 00:29:41.120 || that a declaration of war and i think
00:29:42.950 || 00:29:42.960 || things are happening and yet we don't
00:29:45.750 || 00:29:45.760 || even realize what we are doing how close
00:29:48.070 || 00:29:48.080 || we are to world war three and the worst
00:29:50.389 || 00:29:50.399 || part about it is that we think these
00:29:52.389 || 00:29:52.399 || sanctions have are having an effect on
00:29:54.230 || 00:29:54.240 || russia yet 80 percent of the world is
00:29:56.149 || 00:29:56.159 || doing business with russia right now and
00:29:57.269 || 00:29:57.279 || we're not
00:29:58.870 || 00:29:58.880 || i mean it's just it's we're asleep at
00:30:01.830 || 00:30:01.840 || the switch and then we have the nerve to
00:30:04.789 || 00:30:04.799 || go to saudi arabia supposedly and ask
00:30:06.870 || 00:30:06.880 || him for more oil that's not why he went
00:30:08.789 || 00:30:08.799 || when we say we're going green in the
00:30:10.789 || 00:30:10.799 || next 20 years we're going to destroy the
00:30:12.789 || 00:30:12.799 || way of life of the saudis we're going
00:30:14.310 || 00:30:14.320 || completely green we're getting rid of
00:30:16.630 || 00:30:16.640 || fossil fuels at the same time they make
00:30:18.070 || 00:30:18.080 || this announcement in california they
00:30:19.510 || 00:30:19.520 || tell you not to charge your car even
00:30:20.950 || 00:30:20.960 || though we're all going
00:30:22.310 || 00:30:22.320 || digital i mean we're all going
00:30:25.029 || 00:30:25.039 || battery-powered vehicles but he went to
00:30:26.789 || 00:30:26.799 || saudi arabia to beg him not to join the
00:30:29.269 || 00:30:29.279 || bricks because when that happens it's
00:30:31.190 || 00:30:31.200 || game over and it's going to happen on a
00:30:32.710 || 00:30:32.720 || sunday night we're going to wake up on a
00:30:34.549 || 00:30:34.559 || monday morning and the dollar won't be
00:30:36.149 || 00:30:36.159 || the world reserve currency anymore or at
00:30:38.630 || 00:30:38.640 || least not the petro dollar any longer
00:30:41.110 || 00:30:41.120 || and that's when things get really really
00:30:43.430 || 00:30:43.440 || scary and that's when my prediction
00:30:46.149 || 00:30:46.159 || about you won't find anything happens
00:30:48.630 || 00:30:48.640 || really fast and if the queen dying is
00:30:51.430 || 00:30:51.440 || enough to dry up all of the coins with
00:30:53.430 || 00:30:53.440 || the queen's face on them
00:30:55.430 || 00:30:55.440 || when i run out of what i have what's
00:30:57.190 || 00:30:57.200 || gonna happen when the markets fall five
00:30:59.750 || 00:30:59.760 || thousand points or seven thousand points
00:31:02.389 || 00:31:02.399 || or more and i think those days are
00:31:05.350 || 00:31:05.360 || coming i wish i wish i wish to god i
00:31:08.070 || 00:31:08.080 || didn't feel the way i do i really do i
00:31:10.710 || 00:31:10.720 || hope i'm wrong i hope i'm wrong and if
00:31:12.470 || 00:31:12.480 || people five years do not say you were
00:31:14.230 || 00:31:14.240 || wrong i'll take pride and joy in that
00:31:16.149 || 00:31:16.159 || because my children will grow up in a
00:31:17.830 || 00:31:17.840 || better world than i think they're gonna
00:31:19.750 || 00:31:19.760 || grow up in but i am telling you right
00:31:22.870 || 00:31:22.880 || now if you are not a contrarian you will
00:31:24.710 || 00:31:24.720 || be a victim if this stuff plays out and
00:31:26.950 || 00:31:26.960 || it's time to wake up and realize
00:31:28.710 || 00:31:28.720 || this is what's happening
00:31:30.070 || 00:31:30.080 || yeah that's we were my wife and i were
00:31:32.710 || 00:31:32.720 || just talking about that today she said
00:31:34.710 || 00:31:34.720 || our gravest concern that we have is not
00:31:36.470 || 00:31:36.480 || for ourselves it is for our children and
00:31:37.990 || 00:31:38.000 || our grandchildren what kind of a world
00:31:39.909 || 00:31:39.919 || will they have to live in it will not be
00:31:42.549 || 00:31:42.559 || like the one that we that we grew up in
00:31:43.350 || 00:31:43.360 || and
00:31:44.630 || 00:31:44.640 || you know you see me getting more and
00:31:47.509 || 00:31:47.519 || more uh
00:31:49.830 || 00:31:49.840 || wound up about this because when you and
00:31:52.149 || 00:31:52.159 || i started talking about this in 2020 it
00:31:54.070 || 00:31:54.080 || was the belt it was not even the belt
00:31:56.070 || 00:31:56.080 || road initiative it was the tier one
00:31:58.149 || 00:31:58.159 || revision of gold why did it happen and
00:31:59.669 || 00:31:59.679 || why did all the banks repatriate their
00:32:01.350 || 00:32:01.360 || gold trying to figure it out and then
00:32:03.909 || 00:32:03.919 || nancy pelosi says well you know viruses
00:32:05.830 || 00:32:05.840 || can live on currency so i said oh a
00:32:07.909 || 00:32:07.919 || digital currency is coming and then from
00:32:10.549 || 00:32:10.559 || that day forward the belt road and all
00:32:12.549 || 00:32:12.559 || of these things one by one by one by one
00:32:15.110 || 00:32:15.120 || by one that keep happening every single
00:32:17.990 || 00:32:18.000 || week there's a new story that goes along
00:32:20.710 || 00:32:20.720 || with dedolorization and coalescion of
00:32:22.870 || 00:32:22.880 || all of these countries and the us is
00:32:24.710 || 00:32:24.720 || very conspicuously
00:32:26.950 || 00:32:26.960 || not part of it and i think these
00:32:29.750 || 00:32:29.760 || countries are basing this coalition not
00:32:33.909 || 00:32:33.919 || up not just upon the mutual um dislike
00:32:36.470 || 00:32:36.480 || of the west but also a whole new system
00:32:39.669 || 00:32:39.679 || based upon commodities and transparency
00:32:42.230 || 00:32:42.240 || and and honesty the way that it should
00:32:44.630 || 00:32:44.640 || be done the way that uh markets should
00:32:47.110 || 00:32:47.120 || run and what better way to roll out
00:32:49.350 || 00:32:49.360 || distributed ledger technology than to
00:32:52.149 || 00:32:52.159 || peg gold to it and issue a new digital
00:32:53.990 || 00:32:54.000 || currency it'll be it won't be open
00:32:55.830 || 00:32:55.840 || source it'll be a private permission
00:32:58.630 || 00:32:58.640 || only blockchain but they will show what
00:33:01.110 || 00:33:01.120 || has been pegged to it and maybe saudi
00:33:04.389 || 00:33:04.399 || arabia pegs oil and maybe you know uh
00:33:07.110 || 00:33:07.120 || china pegs gold and and or rare earth
00:33:09.909 || 00:33:09.919 || metals and you know russia pegs uh
00:33:11.990 || 00:33:12.000 || platinum and palladium and go who knows
00:33:14.710 || 00:33:14.720 || but you will see it on the ledger and i
00:33:16.389 || 00:33:16.399 || think that's the road we are heading
00:33:20.389 || 00:33:20.399 || down and it will ultimately be necessary
00:33:23.350 || 00:33:23.360 || to ever challenge or ever come out as a
00:33:25.350 || 00:33:25.360 || world reserve currency as the brics
00:33:27.509 || 00:33:27.519 || nation said that they are going to do as
00:33:30.149 || 00:33:30.159 || chief said we are doing this here comes
00:33:32.230 || 00:33:32.240 || you have to peg it you have to peg it
00:33:34.389 || 00:33:34.399 || and show the world that hey we're going
00:33:37.269 || 00:33:37.279 || to break the cycle of governments always
00:33:39.590 || 00:33:39.600 || choosing inflation over austerity always
00:33:41.110 || 00:33:41.120 || choosing the printing press over the
00:33:43.110 || 00:33:43.120 || tough decisions and very quickly that
00:33:45.350 || 00:33:45.360 || will be something that will immediately
00:33:48.070 || 00:33:48.080 || gather a whole lot of attention and a
00:33:50.310 || 00:33:50.320 || whole lot of credibility
00:33:52.789 || 00:33:52.799 || we've had a lot of questions in the chat
00:33:54.149 || 00:33:54.159 || stream as you've been talking first of
00:33:55.190 || 00:33:55.200 || all a lot of people have been really
00:33:58.149 || 00:33:58.159 || appreciative of you being so forthcoming
00:34:00.149 || 00:34:00.159 || they really are are appreciating your
00:34:02.310 || 00:34:02.320 || candor tonight um that's not unusual
00:34:03.909 || 00:34:03.919 || that's why they like to come and talk to
00:34:06.630 || 00:34:06.640 || you on tuesday nights uh you're talking
00:34:09.270 || 00:34:09.280 || about how difficult it is to convince
00:34:10.389 || 00:34:10.399 || family members or friends or
00:34:12.149 || 00:34:12.159 || acquaintances or co-workers whoever who
00:34:14.389 || 00:34:14.399 || see these bear market rallies and get
00:34:15.589 || 00:34:15.599 || all excited about now it's time to get
00:34:16.869 || 00:34:16.879 || back in again like they really don't
00:34:19.030 || 00:34:19.040 || understand the fundamental breakdown of
00:34:21.430 || 00:34:21.440 || what what is happening here frankie
00:34:23.990 || 00:34:24.000 || carbone says family members of mine are
00:34:25.430 || 00:34:25.440 || are thinking of getting back into the
00:34:26.790 || 00:34:26.800 || stock market it's like talking to a
00:34:29.430 || 00:34:29.440 || gambling addict uh we had a person uh
00:34:31.510 || 00:34:31.520 || he's off screen and i can't pull back
00:34:32.710 || 00:34:32.720 || that far because the chat stream has
00:34:34.310 || 00:34:34.320 || gone so far i've tried all the way can't
00:34:36.790 || 00:34:36.800 || get to the top anymore but he said he
00:34:38.389 || 00:34:38.399 || said i made a convert today he's going
00:34:41.510 || 00:34:41.520 || to buy a monster box of canadian maples
00:34:43.589 || 00:34:43.599 || i've had two clients call me today both
00:34:46.069 || 00:34:46.079 || talking about what do i do what do i do
00:34:47.669 || 00:34:47.679 || tell me what to do because they've been
00:34:49.750 || 00:34:49.760 || hearing so many different
00:34:51.510 || 00:34:51.520 || stories about the real estate markets
00:34:53.109 || 00:34:53.119 || going to roll over or
00:34:54.230 || 00:34:54.240 || interest rates are going to spike or
00:34:55.030 || 00:34:55.040 || they're not we're going to go into
00:34:56.950 || 00:34:56.960 || inflation deflation
00:34:59.829 || 00:34:59.839 || people are frankly bewildered people
00:35:01.910 || 00:35:01.920 || most people have no idea either they're
00:35:04.230 || 00:35:04.240 || just sleepwalking or
00:35:05.990 || 00:35:06.000 || they really are confused and don't
00:35:09.670 || 00:35:09.680 || understand there's been a general
00:35:12.230 || 00:35:12.240 || generational loss of understanding of
00:35:13.990 || 00:35:14.000 || what real money is i talked with rafi
00:35:15.910 || 00:35:15.920 || farber or just yesterday we're going to
00:35:17.670 || 00:35:17.680 || post that later this week
00:35:18.870 || 00:35:18.880 || he talked about that people don't
00:35:20.630 || 00:35:20.640 || understand what real money is bill
00:35:22.390 || 00:35:22.400 || holter said the same thing
00:35:24.950 || 00:35:24.960 || but those who are waking up do and they
00:35:26.710 || 00:35:26.720 || know that there's a way to get out of
00:35:27.990 || 00:35:28.000 || harm's way
00:35:29.430 || 00:35:29.440 || everybody's going to get hurt to some
00:35:31.030 || 00:35:31.040 || extent some people there will be there
00:35:32.870 || 00:35:32.880 || will be outsized opportunity
00:35:34.710 || 00:35:34.720 || asymmetrical opportunities that sort of
00:35:37.829 || 00:35:37.839 || thing uh that's how uh david smith rests
00:35:39.750 || 00:35:39.760 || his soul we just had a tribute for him
00:35:41.750 || 00:35:41.760 || yesterday um
00:35:43.349 || 00:35:43.359 || talked about this
00:35:44.950 || 00:35:44.960 || there will be asymmetrical opportunities
00:35:47.270 || 00:35:47.280 || so it isn't all doom and gloom but it is
00:35:49.430 || 00:35:49.440 || serious and you've got to position
00:35:51.430 || 00:35:51.440 || yourself in a place of relative safety
00:35:53.030 || 00:35:53.040 || because many places are not going to be
00:35:55.030 || 00:35:55.040 || safe rick rule told us
00:35:57.270 || 00:35:57.280 || three months ago buckle up volatility
00:35:58.870 || 00:35:58.880 || ahead the swing
00:36:01.990 || 00:36:02.000 || michael uh mike pento said the swings
00:36:04.310 || 00:36:04.320 || are going to get wider and wilder so
00:36:05.990 || 00:36:06.000 || people who try to do bottom picking and
00:36:07.430 || 00:36:07.440 || top picking are going to find themselves
00:36:10.470 || 00:36:10.480 || just whipsawed all over the place so uh
00:36:13.510 || 00:36:13.520 || in an air in an environment
00:36:14.470 || 00:36:14.480 || where
00:36:17.510 || 00:36:17.520 || it's so confusing if you use if you
00:36:20.470 || 00:36:20.480 || apply the old paradigm to the new
00:36:22.069 || 00:36:22.079 || environment it doesn't make any sense
00:36:23.910 || 00:36:23.920 || nothing works anymore and that's where
00:36:26.230 || 00:36:26.240 || you're saying folks wake up the paradigm
00:36:28.790 || 00:36:28.800 || really has changed you need to look at
00:36:30.390 || 00:36:30.400 || this through new eyes to see it
00:36:32.150 || 00:36:32.160 || correctly and then you'll understand
00:36:33.349 || 00:36:33.359 || where we're going
00:36:35.750 || 00:36:35.760 || yeah you have to and and you have to
00:36:37.910 || 00:36:37.920 || realize that we're in uncharted waters
00:36:39.670 || 00:36:39.680 || and your gut is your best financial
00:36:41.910 || 00:36:41.920 || advisor you know i don't want to paint a
00:36:44.150 || 00:36:44.160 || broad stroke on financial advisories and
00:36:46.150 || 00:36:46.160 || every time i say what i'm about to say i
00:36:49.190 || 00:36:49.200 || get a lot of angry emails from financial
00:36:51.190 || 00:36:51.200 || advisors you know i'm not like this i'm
00:36:52.550 || 00:36:52.560 || not like this but
00:36:54.230 || 00:36:54.240 || they used to be called stock brokers in
00:36:57.510 || 00:36:57.520 || the 90s when i started in this industry
00:36:59.829 || 00:36:59.839 || and they made money on trades and and
00:37:02.550 || 00:37:02.560 || now you get free trades and so they make
00:37:04.470 || 00:37:04.480 || their money by keeping your money under
00:37:06.870 || 00:37:06.880 || management and so when you come to them
00:37:09.829 || 00:37:09.839 || and express your concern about hey you
00:37:11.430 || 00:37:11.440 || know i'm really concerned i want to put
00:37:13.109 || 00:37:13.119 || some money into gold i want to pull my
00:37:14.790 || 00:37:14.800 || money out of the market and get out of
00:37:16.230 || 00:37:16.240 || harm's way
00:37:17.910 || 00:37:17.920 || the
00:37:20.550 || 00:37:20.560 || response is is typically you know you
00:37:21.990 || 00:37:22.000 || don't want to do that why would you do
00:37:23.829 || 00:37:23.839 || that it's adversarial people call me
00:37:25.190 || 00:37:25.200 || they're afraid to call their own money
00:37:27.430 || 00:37:27.440 || managers look you know
00:37:28.310 || 00:37:28.320 || um
00:37:30.950 || 00:37:30.960 || these are our periods of time that most
00:37:32.870 || 00:37:32.880 || money managers you know just about every
00:37:35.349 || 00:37:35.359 || one of them haven't you know all of them
00:37:36.790 || 00:37:36.800 || they've lived through nothing but good
00:37:38.870 || 00:37:38.880 || times more or less
00:37:40.310 || 00:37:40.320 || and i think this time is different i
00:37:41.990 || 00:37:42.000 || think you trust your gut i think you get
00:37:44.870 || 00:37:44.880 || out of harm's way i think um you take
00:37:47.589 || 00:37:47.599 || accountability for for your actions
00:37:49.349 || 00:37:49.359 || every day why not take accountability
00:37:52.069 || 00:37:52.079 || for your finances and it's time it's
00:37:54.069 || 00:37:54.079 || time to do that it's time to realize
00:37:55.270 || 00:37:55.280 || that um
00:37:57.109 || 00:37:57.119 || you know
00:37:59.829 || 00:37:59.839 || all of the best laid plans need to be
00:38:01.829 || 00:38:01.839 || reevaluated from time to time and this
00:38:04.310 || 00:38:04.320 || this is one of them this is one of those
00:38:05.349 || 00:38:05.359 || times
00:38:06.710 || 00:38:06.720 || you know
00:38:08.230 || 00:38:08.240 || the federal reserve and the u.s
00:38:11.190 || 00:38:11.200 || government so badly horribly distorted
00:38:12.790 || 00:38:12.800 || um
00:38:15.990 || 00:38:16.000 || price discovery and asset values
00:38:18.390 || 00:38:18.400 || that i think people got really excited
00:38:20.550 || 00:38:20.560 || that they became wealthy over the last
00:38:21.990 || 00:38:22.000 || two years without doing anything
00:38:23.750 || 00:38:23.760 || watching their 401k and their house
00:38:26.150 || 00:38:26.160 || price go higher and this is a very
00:38:29.190 || 00:38:29.200 || dangerous thing it really is because i i
00:38:30.710 || 00:38:30.720 || think um
00:38:34.950 || 00:38:34.960 || they're going to be reluctant to believe
00:38:35.829 || 00:38:35.839 || that
00:38:38.470 || 00:38:38.480 || the continual bleeding of values is
00:38:39.910 || 00:38:39.920 || anything but a
00:38:42.230 || 00:38:42.240 || short-term correction because you look
00:38:45.030 || 00:38:45.040 || at 2008 and it was the same horrible
00:38:46.950 || 00:38:46.960 || thing and yet
00:38:48.069 || 00:38:48.079 || everything
00:38:50.069 || 00:38:50.079 || came back well why did it come back you
00:38:51.750 || 00:38:51.760 || know that's the part that people aren't
00:38:53.349 || 00:38:53.359 || missing you know all you hear from these
00:38:54.870 || 00:38:54.880 || advice well everything came back if you
00:38:57.030 || 00:38:57.040 || just want to hold held on you would have
00:38:59.589 || 00:38:59.599 || been okay the fed balance sheet went
00:39:02.310 || 00:39:02.320 || from 800 billion to 9 trillion dollars
00:39:04.950 || 00:39:04.960 || over the ensuing 12 years
00:39:06.390 || 00:39:06.400 || all of that
00:39:08.790 || 00:39:08.800 || investment went into treasuries and
00:39:11.349 || 00:39:11.359 || mortgage-backed securities both of those
00:39:12.550 || 00:39:12.560 || investments
00:39:14.710 || 00:39:14.720 || drive down interest rates
00:39:16.710 || 00:39:16.720 || when you drive down interest rates you
00:39:20.710 || 00:39:20.720 || create a illusion of prosperity in what
00:39:24.390 || 00:39:24.400 || 401ks stock portfolios in real estate
00:39:26.310 || 00:39:26.320 || and then you put the
00:39:29.270 || 00:39:29.280 || six trillion dollar icing on the cake
00:39:32.950 || 00:39:32.960 || um and most of that free money went into
00:39:34.710 || 00:39:34.720 || assets where hedge funds can borrow
00:39:36.710 || 00:39:36.720 || money at next to nothing and put it plow
00:39:39.030 || 00:39:39.040 || it into equities and real estate and all
00:39:41.589 || 00:39:41.599 || of these assets make a fortune cover
00:39:44.550 || 00:39:44.560 || their one percent loan get huge bonuses
00:39:46.230 || 00:39:46.240 || and you have asset prices in
00:39:48.470 || 00:39:48.480 || stratospheric level
00:39:50.550 || 00:39:50.560 || that when rates rise to where they
00:39:51.750 || 00:39:51.760 || should be
00:39:54.150 || 00:39:54.160 || not set by the banks but set by the
00:39:55.349 || 00:39:55.359 || market
00:39:58.230 || 00:39:58.240 || everything is going to be um
00:40:00.150 || 00:40:00.160 || everything is going to be awful and it's
00:40:01.750 || 00:40:01.760 || going to be very frightening when this
00:40:03.190 || 00:40:03.200 || happens and
00:40:06.550 || 00:40:06.560 || i'm convinced i truly am convinced that
00:40:09.030 || 00:40:09.040 || that it's going to happen not by the fed
00:40:11.510 || 00:40:11.520 || the fed's gonna raise rates high enough
00:40:13.430 || 00:40:13.440 || to where there'll be talk of them coming
00:40:15.750 || 00:40:15.760 || in and stopping it and easing this is
00:40:17.430 || 00:40:17.440 || why you see the inversion of the yield
00:40:20.390 || 00:40:20.400 || curve but the fed is a sideshow i think
00:40:22.790 || 00:40:22.800 || the market and the worldwide market and
00:40:25.109 || 00:40:25.119 || the worldwide realization that holding
00:40:28.710 || 00:40:28.720 || dollars is a suckers game holding
00:40:30.870 || 00:40:30.880 || treasuries is even worse
00:40:33.470 || 00:40:33.480 || and and that is what is partially
00:40:35.990 || 00:40:36.000 || incentivizing along with all of the
00:40:39.589 || 00:40:39.599 || things we've talked about the need for a
00:40:42.550 || 00:40:42.560 || sound monetary system well it's going to
00:40:44.870 || 00:40:44.880 || come by hooker crook and i think it
00:40:47.910 || 00:40:47.920 || comes over there before it comes over
00:40:50.150 || 00:40:50.160 || here by default and this is the great
00:40:52.550 || 00:40:52.560 || reset that klaus schwab talks about when
00:40:55.510 || 00:40:55.520 || it happens over there first that means
00:40:58.550 || 00:40:58.560 || dollars get dumped in mass and all end
00:41:00.710 || 00:41:00.720 || up on shore here with interest rates
00:41:03.589 || 00:41:03.599 || spiking and it happens immediately and
00:41:05.589 || 00:41:05.599 || this is why people need to be proactive
00:41:07.910 || 00:41:07.920 || if you have this gnawing feeling in your
00:41:08.710 || 00:41:08.720 || gut
00:41:10.550 || 00:41:10.560 || get off the toilet
00:41:12.470 || 00:41:12.480 || or get on it and do what you're supposed
00:41:15.109 || 00:41:15.119 || to do i guess you should say you know do
00:41:16.790 || 00:41:16.800 || it or get off you know what i'm trying
00:41:19.190 || 00:41:19.200 || to say i just simply mean if you have
00:41:22.309 || 00:41:22.319 || this feeling in your gut don't
00:41:24.150 || 00:41:24.160 || don't say damn it i knew i should have
00:41:26.470 || 00:41:26.480 || done that i knew it i saw it i knew it
00:41:28.150 || 00:41:28.160 || how many times have you all out there
00:41:30.150 || 00:41:30.160 || said i knew i should have done that i
00:41:32.470 || 00:41:32.480 || knew it i felt it and i didn't do it
00:41:34.470 || 00:41:34.480 || whether it be about relationships or
00:41:36.230 || 00:41:36.240 || business decisions or
00:41:37.670 || 00:41:37.680 || anything
00:41:39.510 || 00:41:39.520 || this is the time to trust your gut
00:41:42.470 || 00:41:42.480 || because financial advisories are no more
00:41:44.550 || 00:41:44.560 || in tune to what's happening than you are
00:41:46.870 || 00:41:46.880 || in fact they're probably less in tune
00:41:49.270 || 00:41:49.280 || because many of them not all of them i
00:41:51.190 || 00:41:51.200 || work with some very good ones who who
00:41:52.390 || 00:41:52.400 || really are
00:41:55.190 || 00:41:55.200 || in tune to this but a lot of them
00:41:56.790 || 00:41:56.800 || know more and more about less and less
00:41:58.390 || 00:41:58.400 || until they know everything about nothing
00:42:00.150 || 00:42:00.160 || and they think the road to retirement is
00:42:02.710 || 00:42:02.720 || only paved with tight grips on mutual
00:42:05.589 || 00:42:05.599 || funds stock certificates and a 40 bond
00:42:08.309 || 00:42:08.319 || allocation well i got news for you if
00:42:10.790 || 00:42:10.800 || what hap if if what i see happens
00:42:11.990 || 00:42:12.000 || happens
00:42:13.349 || 00:42:13.359 || those are
00:42:15.270 || 00:42:15.280 || the portfolios that get crushed the
00:42:17.030 || 00:42:17.040 || hardest
00:42:18.470 || 00:42:18.480 || i mentioned you mentioned a little while
00:42:20.309 || 00:42:20.319 || ago about the passing of the queen last
00:42:23.109 || 00:42:23.119 || week uh i understand you've
00:42:26.150 || 00:42:26.160 || you got some tips we had you on briefly
00:42:28.470 || 00:42:28.480 || later in the week to talk about how
00:42:30.150 || 00:42:30.160 || companies and individuals were were
00:42:31.910 || 00:42:31.920 || scooping up uh
00:42:33.349 || 00:42:33.359 || coins that had the image of the queen on
00:42:35.670 || 00:42:35.680 || them uh and now those are becoming hard
00:42:37.750 || 00:42:37.760 || to get premiums are spiking up on those
00:42:40.230 || 00:42:40.240 || you've still tried to to hold down
00:42:41.990 || 00:42:42.000 || premiums on some of those that you had
00:42:46.309 || 00:42:46.319 || in stock already yeah i have and i i you
00:42:47.910 || 00:42:47.920 || know the queen elizabeth will no longer
00:42:49.829 || 00:42:49.839 || be on any of the coins moving forward
00:42:52.309 || 00:42:52.319 || and so it's i think it's me the king
00:42:56.069 || 00:42:56.079 || king charles i guess moving forward um
00:42:58.950 || 00:42:58.960 || yeah they have and you know it's a
00:43:01.109 || 00:43:01.119 || situation where a lot of people believe
00:43:05.190 || 00:43:05.200 || it'll be a a collector's item so the the
00:43:07.109 || 00:43:07.119 || britannia is that we're offering at five
00:43:08.790 || 00:43:08.800 || and a quarter over spot i gotta believe
00:43:10.470 || 00:43:10.480 || that's the best price in the country on
00:43:13.430 || 00:43:13.440 || 2022's i really do try done again i
00:43:15.510 || 00:43:15.520 || really do
00:43:17.430 || 00:43:17.440 || try to make it a special when i call it
00:43:18.870 || 00:43:18.880 || a special
00:43:19.670 || 00:43:19.680 || uh
00:43:21.510 || 00:43:21.520 || and you know
00:43:24.069 || 00:43:24.079 || this this is and the maples too right so
00:43:26.470 || 00:43:26.480 || the maples at six bucks over
00:43:27.270 || 00:43:27.280 || um
00:43:30.390 || 00:43:30.400 || when i sell out of these
00:43:32.630 || 00:43:32.640 || i won't be able to get any new 2022s on
00:43:34.710 || 00:43:34.720 || either of them without paying an arm and
00:43:36.630 || 00:43:36.640 || a leg which i really don't
00:43:38.069 || 00:43:38.079 || care to do
00:43:40.630 || 00:43:40.640 || it defeats the purpose somewhat akin to
00:43:42.470 || 00:43:42.480 || selling the the silver american eagles
00:43:44.870 || 00:43:44.880 || which you rarely if ever hear me talk
00:43:45.750 || 00:43:45.760 || about
00:43:48.870 || 00:43:48.880 || for this reason but um yeah i i think
00:43:51.190 || 00:43:51.200 || that it's interesting that that she
00:43:53.349 || 00:43:53.359 || passes and then not only does everything
00:43:56.069 || 00:43:56.079 || with her likeness on it go up but so too
00:43:58.069 || 00:43:58.079 || do all of the other sovereign coins that
00:44:00.470 || 00:44:00.480 || don't have her likeness on it just by
00:44:03.190 || 00:44:03.200 || default this is what i was talking about
00:44:06.470 || 00:44:06.480 || the of the micro fragility of this
00:44:08.470 || 00:44:08.480 || industry one little event
00:44:10.230 || 00:44:10.240 || uh and and
00:44:12.790 || 00:44:12.800 || and it sends reverberations through the
00:44:15.270 || 00:44:15.280 || industry this is a little event what
00:44:17.270 || 00:44:17.280 || we're talking about is a macro event
00:44:19.270 || 00:44:19.280 || which obliterates the supply in a matter
00:44:22.069 || 00:44:22.079 || of days or hours and that is what i have
00:44:24.550 || 00:44:24.560 || been talking about all along when i say
00:44:26.150 || 00:44:26.160 || the market will be defined by an
00:44:27.910 || 00:44:27.920 || inability to source product people say
00:44:29.589 || 00:44:29.599 || well he's got product he's just talking
00:44:31.910 || 00:44:31.920 || his book i can find it look jm bullion
00:44:34.470 || 00:44:34.480 || has it look at mex says it sure they do
00:44:36.550 || 00:44:36.560 || until that happens and then no one's
00:44:39.030 || 00:44:39.040 || gonna have it just like that and that i
00:44:40.870 || 00:44:40.880 || can promise you because
00:44:42.630 || 00:44:42.640 || if i can't buy
00:44:45.750 || 00:44:45.760 || new britannians without paying a fortune
00:44:46.870 || 00:44:46.880 || um
00:44:47.910 || 00:44:47.920 || you know
00:44:50.069 || 00:44:50.079 || what happens when there's a real event
00:44:52.069 || 00:44:52.079 || that that just makes getting product
00:44:55.270 || 00:44:55.280 || next to impossible so
00:44:56.870 || 00:44:56.880 || lesson to be learned from that just a
00:44:58.630 || 00:44:58.640 || little bitty one
00:45:01.829 || 00:45:01.839 || and in addition to those uh british and
00:45:03.430 || 00:45:03.440 || uh canadian coins they have the queen in
00:45:05.510 || 00:45:05.520 || the back you've also got some bars at a
00:45:07.109 || 00:45:07.119 || lower price point because i noticed
00:45:08.309 || 00:45:08.319 || because the premiums have been pushing
00:45:09.829 || 00:45:09.839 || up on everything you were trying to
00:45:11.190 || 00:45:11.200 || still find some things at low price
00:45:12.950 || 00:45:12.960 || points and this particular other product
00:45:15.670 || 00:45:15.680 || i remember you had in your case at the
00:45:18.470 || 00:45:18.480 || rule uh symposium in on
00:45:20.790 || 00:45:20.800 || natural resource investing in boca raton
00:45:22.870 || 00:45:22.880 || florida and a lot of people were
00:45:24.150 || 00:45:24.160 || gathering around your case and were
00:45:25.750 || 00:45:25.760 || familiar with most of the things in it
00:45:27.349 || 00:45:27.359 || but that there was one item that was
00:45:28.309 || 00:45:28.319 || getting people's attention
00:45:29.430 || 00:45:29.440 || disproportionately because they'd never
00:45:31.030 || 00:45:31.040 || seen anything like it before
00:45:32.470 || 00:45:32.480 || everybody loves them they are the
00:45:34.710 || 00:45:34.720 || coolest bars i've ever seen and they are
00:45:36.870 || 00:45:36.880 || by far the best price in the country
00:45:39.829 || 00:45:39.839 || and they are supremely cool uh they are
00:45:42.550 || 00:45:42.560 || the valcambi 10 ounce
00:45:43.510 || 00:45:43.520 || bar
00:45:46.630 || 00:45:46.640 || they come in boxes of 50 500 to a box
00:45:48.550 || 00:45:48.560 || but they're little itty bitty cubes
00:45:50.390 || 00:45:50.400 || every other 10 ounce bar you find in the
00:45:52.390 || 00:45:52.400 || market is long and thin these are so
00:45:54.950 || 00:45:54.960 || cool uh the way they're packaged it's so
00:45:57.589 || 00:45:57.599 || neat i love them i truly do love them
00:45:59.829 || 00:45:59.839 || and i have been buying valcambi kilos
00:46:01.829 || 00:46:01.839 || and now these for the last year it's
00:46:04.309 || 00:46:04.319 || been my primary accumulation myself
00:46:06.390 || 00:46:06.400 || personally because i i love the
00:46:08.470 || 00:46:08.480 || sovereignty coins i just have a hard
00:46:11.030 || 00:46:11.040 || time paying these really high premiums
00:46:13.109 || 00:46:13.119 || look these premiums on all of these
00:46:14.950 || 00:46:14.960 || coins are double or more what they've
00:46:19.510 || 00:46:19.520 || been for my 33-year career and um
00:46:22.230 || 00:46:22.240 || i just find much better value
00:46:24.309 || 00:46:24.319 || in these bars these bars just happen to
00:46:26.069 || 00:46:26.079 || blow everyone away everyone who sees
00:46:27.270 || 00:46:27.280 || them says oh my gosh those are the
00:46:28.630 || 00:46:28.640 || cutest things those are the coolest
00:46:31.270 || 00:46:31.280 || things i love them and they really are
00:46:34.069 || 00:46:34.079 || um you don't buy things like this
00:46:36.150 || 00:46:36.160 || because they're cool but maybe you do i
00:46:39.670 || 00:46:39.680 || mean you know it can start out as as a
00:46:41.829 || 00:46:41.839 || an investment or a hedge and become a
00:46:42.950 || 00:46:42.960 || hobby
00:46:45.670 || 00:46:45.680 || and they're fun to look at um so i love
00:46:47.430 || 00:46:47.440 || these they're about yay big they're like
00:46:48.950 || 00:46:48.960 || a little like
00:46:52.230 || 00:46:52.240 || a dove like a those chocolate bars dove
00:46:54.150 || 00:46:54.160 || chocolate bars like a cube they're
00:46:55.510 || 00:46:55.520 || awesome and
00:46:57.750 || 00:46:57.760 || my favorite choice right now by far of
00:46:59.990 || 00:47:00.000 || anything that we're selling are these 10
00:47:01.510 || 00:47:01.520 || ounce bars
00:47:03.270 || 00:47:03.280 || yeah i remember uh
00:47:05.109 || 00:47:05.119 || being around your your booth there where
00:47:06.470 || 00:47:06.480 || people were saying can i just can i just
00:47:08.150 || 00:47:08.160 || touch one can i hold that can i take a
00:47:09.670 || 00:47:09.680 || look at that it's funny when people say
00:47:10.870 || 00:47:10.880 || can i look at that they don't mean can
00:47:11.990 || 00:47:12.000 || they look at they're already looking at
00:47:13.270 || 00:47:13.280 || it but they mean this can i want a
00:47:14.470 || 00:47:14.480 || little bit
00:47:16.150 || 00:47:16.160 || no they're really cool they're really
00:47:18.710 || 00:47:18.720 || really really neat and uh highly highly
00:47:21.109 || 00:47:21.119 || recommend them and so i was glad to be
00:47:23.829 || 00:47:23.839 || able to secure a nice supply of them and
00:47:27.750 || 00:47:27.760 || offer them on special this week
00:47:29.670 || 00:47:29.680 || uh so there were some other questions in
00:47:32.630 || 00:47:32.640 || the live chat about i'll answer them
00:47:34.630 || 00:47:34.640 || from multiple people about the potential
00:47:36.470 || 00:47:36.480 || for a u.s rail strike we've certainly
00:47:38.470 || 00:47:38.480 || had a lot of shipping disruptions
00:47:40.309 || 00:47:40.319 || there's been
00:47:42.550 || 00:47:42.560 || ships actual you know container ships
00:47:44.630 || 00:47:44.640 || suspended but first the chinese locked
00:47:46.550 || 00:47:46.560 || down their ports then they couldn't get
00:47:48.069 || 00:47:48.079 || into the harbors and
00:47:50.069 || 00:47:50.079 || in the ports here in the u.s we've had
00:47:51.270 || 00:47:51.280 || trucking problems we've interviewed
00:47:53.109 || 00:47:53.119 || trucking industry experts now it looks
00:47:54.390 || 00:47:54.400 || like it's going to be the rail system
00:47:56.710 || 00:47:56.720 || the major freight
00:47:57.750 || 00:47:57.760 || rail
00:47:59.190 || 00:47:59.200 || lines in the u.s are announcing that
00:48:01.109 || 00:48:01.119 || they're going to be cutting back because
00:48:03.190 || 00:48:03.200 || of a pending strike
00:48:05.589 || 00:48:05.599 || just any thoughts from your standpoint
00:48:06.470 || 00:48:06.480 || on the
00:48:08.309 || 00:48:08.319 || fragility of
00:48:12.630 || 00:48:12.640 || uh the supply chain logistically and how
00:48:14.870 || 00:48:14.880 || that affects not just precious metals
00:48:17.589 || 00:48:17.599 || how it affects our lives and what people
00:48:19.270 || 00:48:19.280 || what we're heading into
00:48:21.430 || 00:48:21.440 || it just feels like a planned a planned
00:48:22.710 || 00:48:22.720 || demolition
00:48:25.589 || 00:48:25.599 || we're hearing about perhaps a ups strike
00:48:27.829 || 00:48:27.839 || it's just a planned demolition and i
00:48:29.910 || 00:48:29.920 || don't know it just it just
00:48:31.430 || 00:48:31.440 || you know
00:48:33.270 || 00:48:33.280 || things just keep happening and whether
00:48:36.790 || 00:48:36.800 || it be domestically or or or offshore
00:48:40.710 || 00:48:40.720 || things just keep happening that are
00:48:43.349 || 00:48:43.359 || breaking the whole system down so yeah i
00:48:45.430 || 00:48:45.440 || mean look if there's a rail strike sure
00:48:46.950 || 00:48:46.960 || that's not going to have as profound
00:48:48.950 || 00:48:48.960 || effect on this industry as it will on
00:48:51.750 || 00:48:51.760 || the economy at large but most everything
00:48:53.670 || 00:48:53.680 || that you know in this country that that
00:48:56.230 || 00:48:56.240 || goes by truck much of it
00:48:59.430 || 00:48:59.440 || goes by rail first or or vice versa but
00:49:02.150 || 00:49:02.160 || it would be a huge problem if you start
00:49:04.549 || 00:49:04.559 || to see more supply chain problems only
00:49:07.109 || 00:49:07.119 || exacerbate the the
00:49:10.790 || 00:49:10.800 || the uh price inflation and you know you
00:49:12.710 || 00:49:12.720 || have all this money sloshing around
00:49:13.750 || 00:49:13.760 || chasing
00:49:16.390 || 00:49:16.400 || little little supply pools where
00:49:17.910 || 00:49:17.920 || you know it's getting harder and harder
00:49:19.510 || 00:49:19.520 || to get stuff if you see something like
00:49:20.309 || 00:49:20.319 || this
00:49:22.950 || 00:49:22.960 || only making it much worse you know i uh
00:49:25.349 || 00:49:25.359 || i went to look at a car that that i was
00:49:28.390 || 00:49:28.400 || interested in um and i was told it's a
00:49:30.710 || 00:49:30.720 || two and a half year wait for it i mean
00:49:33.109 || 00:49:33.119 || what a two and a half year wait for a
00:49:33.910 || 00:49:33.920 || car
00:49:36.069 || 00:49:36.079 || um
00:49:38.069 || 00:49:38.079 || this is just more of the same you know
00:49:40.390 || 00:49:40.400 || again what is inflation it is more money
00:49:43.589 || 00:49:43.599 || chasing fewer goods and and services
00:49:45.589 || 00:49:45.599 || well but that's exactly what we've seen
00:49:47.829 || 00:49:47.839 || and this is more of the same thing if we
00:49:51.270 || 00:49:51.280 || see a rail strike if we see a ups strike
00:49:53.030 || 00:49:53.040 || it's just more and more difficulty
00:49:54.790 || 00:49:54.800 || getting product you'll see prices go
00:49:56.069 || 00:49:56.079 || higher
00:49:57.589 || 00:49:57.599 || it's just it's just more and more
00:49:59.349 || 00:49:59.359 || frustration done again i i don't know
00:50:00.710 || 00:50:00.720 || it's um
00:50:02.630 || 00:50:02.640 || it's something that i think is the last
00:50:04.309 || 00:50:04.319 || thing that we need at this point right
00:50:07.910 || 00:50:07.920 || now uh is is a rail strike and making it
00:50:10.950 || 00:50:10.960 || much more difficult to you know to get
00:50:12.390 || 00:50:12.400 || products and necessities to the
00:50:13.750 || 00:50:13.760 || marketplace
00:50:15.430 || 00:50:15.440 || and um
00:50:17.510 || 00:50:17.520 || wouldn't surprise me though you know it
00:50:19.750 || 00:50:19.760 || wouldn't surprise me any more than the
00:50:21.910 || 00:50:21.920 || fires in all of the food processing
00:50:22.870 || 00:50:22.880 || plants
00:50:26.069 || 00:50:26.079 || wouldn't surprise me any more than than
00:50:27.510 || 00:50:27.520 || all of the crazy things that we're
00:50:29.430 || 00:50:29.440 || seeing in this country just you shake
00:50:31.829 || 00:50:31.839 || your head every single day and what is
00:50:34.150 || 00:50:34.160 || what what is precipitating all of this
00:50:35.910 || 00:50:35.920 || madness i'm not quite sure but let's
00:50:38.150 || 00:50:38.160 || hope that doesn't happen because if it
00:50:40.390 || 00:50:40.400 || does it's only going to make a tough
00:50:43.190 || 00:50:43.200 || situation in this economy worse yeah we
00:50:45.750 || 00:50:45.760 || interviewed uh mike adams uh founder of
00:50:47.990 || 00:50:48.000 || brighton and uh known as the health
00:50:49.750 || 00:50:49.760 || ranger on our channel just about a week
00:50:54.069 || 00:50:54.079 || ago and uh couldn't post it here but
00:50:56.630 || 00:50:56.640 || one of the things he did talk about was
00:50:59.750 || 00:50:59.760 || that he said their multiple suppliers of
00:51:01.109 || 00:51:01.119 || storable
00:51:02.470 || 00:51:02.480 || camping food
00:51:04.630 || 00:51:04.640 || freeze-dried food dehydrated food
00:51:06.150 || 00:51:06.160 || have been telling their customers for
00:51:07.670 || 00:51:07.680 || the past year
00:51:08.870 || 00:51:08.880 || that they
00:51:11.030 || 00:51:11.040 || aren't able to fill orders because they
00:51:13.190 || 00:51:13.200 || can't get supply he said that is not the
00:51:15.030 || 00:51:15.040 || case that they were specifically
00:51:16.150 || 00:51:16.160 || approached by the united states
00:51:18.870 || 00:51:18.880 || government department of state and told
00:51:20.230 || 00:51:20.240 || to
00:51:22.790 || 00:51:22.800 || fill enormous quantities of orders uh
00:51:25.109 || 00:51:25.119 || for the federal government and
00:51:26.549 || 00:51:26.559 || that uh
00:51:27.829 || 00:51:27.839 || that that's what they've been doing that
00:51:30.470 || 00:51:30.480 || that they've been that the that the
00:51:31.990 || 00:51:32.000 || state department's been buying up all
00:51:34.069 || 00:51:34.079 || these uh food storable food supplies
00:51:35.030 || 00:51:35.040 || that sort of thing we've heard about
00:51:36.630 || 00:51:36.640 || certain state of washington and
00:51:37.990 || 00:51:38.000 || stockpiling food we've heard of other
00:51:40.390 || 00:51:40.400 || states doing that as well so from the
00:51:42.069 || 00:51:42.079 || roots of our channel from reluctant
00:51:45.190 || 00:51:45.200 || preppers on to now uh even now in our
00:51:46.950 || 00:51:46.960 || tagline it's awareness preparedness and
00:51:48.470 || 00:51:48.480 || bullion sales so still awareness and
00:51:49.990 || 00:51:50.000 || preparedness
00:51:51.589 || 00:51:51.599 || folks you know what part of the country
00:51:53.030 || 00:51:53.040 || you live in what weather is going to
00:51:55.109 || 00:51:55.119 || affect you this winter you know whether
00:51:56.950 || 00:51:56.960 || you have water available based on what
00:51:58.470 || 00:51:58.480 || part of the country you live in you know
00:51:59.990 || 00:52:00.000 || whether you're going how
00:52:01.510 || 00:52:01.520 || where your food is going to come from do
00:52:03.829 || 00:52:03.839 || you know your local food producers etc
00:52:06.150 || 00:52:06.160 || you've got to take those actions now and
00:52:07.670 || 00:52:07.680 || andy was saying trust your gut earlier
00:52:08.870 || 00:52:08.880 || and take action
00:52:10.549 || 00:52:10.559 || this is not a time for contemplation
00:52:12.230 || 00:52:12.240 || this is a time for action
00:52:13.589 || 00:52:13.599 || we have a question here from stephen
00:52:14.710 || 00:52:14.720 || fleming
00:52:16.309 || 00:52:16.319 || does andy see
00:52:18.630 || 00:52:18.640 || premiums going down as the market goes
00:52:20.549 || 00:52:20.559 || down
00:52:21.670 || 00:52:21.680 || no
00:52:23.829 || 00:52:23.839 || i see premiums going up if the market
00:52:25.030 || 00:52:25.040 || goes down
00:52:26.470 || 00:52:26.480 || uh and
00:52:27.589 || 00:52:27.599 || because
00:52:29.589 || 00:52:29.599 || especially in this environment i mean
00:52:32.150 || 00:52:32.160 || when the price falls we do more business
00:52:34.309 || 00:52:34.319 || than ever because there are so many
00:52:35.910 || 00:52:35.920 || people who understand what's happening
00:52:38.230 || 00:52:38.240 || who understand that you know that this
00:52:40.630 || 00:52:40.640 || is just overt manipulation so no i don't
00:52:43.829 || 00:52:43.839 || see premiums going down as as prices go
00:52:45.109 || 00:52:45.119 || down um
00:52:47.190 || 00:52:47.200 || not at all in fact quite to the to the
00:52:49.670 || 00:52:49.680 || contrary they usually move inverse of
00:52:51.589 || 00:52:51.599 || each other
00:52:53.030 || 00:52:53.040 || in fact uh that's
00:52:55.030 || 00:52:55.040 || the last time we had a huge spike down
00:52:56.470 || 00:52:56.480 || and i want to talk about this let's zero
00:52:57.910 || 00:52:57.920 || in on this for a minute so the last time
00:52:59.589 || 00:52:59.599 || we had a huge spike down in silver was
00:53:01.670 || 00:53:01.680 || march of 2020 beginning of the whole
00:53:03.030 || 00:53:03.040 || coveted lockdowns everything everybody
00:53:05.109 || 00:53:05.119 || kind of panicked and the whole world was
00:53:08.069 || 00:53:08.079 || locking down uh the equity markets took
00:53:09.430 || 00:53:09.440 || it took a dive
00:53:11.750 || 00:53:11.760 || the metals markets took a dive silver
00:53:13.670 || 00:53:13.680 || spot price went down like 11.88 or
00:53:15.349 || 00:53:15.359 || something like that and yet you couldn't
00:53:16.790 || 00:53:16.800 || find silver eagles anywhere for less
00:53:19.670 || 00:53:19.680 || than 24 bucks so that was like you know
00:53:21.990 || 00:53:22.000 || 100 premium um
00:53:23.910 || 00:53:23.920 || that's the kind of recent experience
00:53:26.069 || 00:53:26.079 || that that i observed as a broker but i
00:53:27.990 || 00:53:28.000 || guess you can comment on that is that in
00:53:30.069 || 00:53:30.079 || a time when the markets are getting
00:53:31.190 || 00:53:31.200 || spooked
00:53:33.750 || 00:53:33.760 || and the spot price may be uh taking a
00:53:35.510 || 00:53:35.520 || dive doesn't mean you can get physical
00:53:37.829 || 00:53:37.839 || for that price same thing happened in o8
00:53:39.349 || 00:53:39.359 || and this is when a lot of the
00:53:42.150 || 00:53:42.160 || realization of market manipulation
00:53:43.670 || 00:53:43.680 || um
00:53:45.750 || 00:53:45.760 || this is when i really started to get it
00:53:47.109 || 00:53:47.119 || um
00:53:49.829 || 00:53:49.839 || in 2008 the price of gold went from a
00:53:52.230 || 00:53:52.240 || thousand to 700 and silver from 21 to
00:53:54.069 || 00:53:54.079 || nine in an incredibly short period of
00:53:56.710 || 00:53:56.720 || time and when that happened all the six
00:53:58.630 || 00:53:58.640 || major mints in the world went offline
00:53:59.349 || 00:53:59.359 || and
00:54:01.670 || 00:54:01.680 || uh the rand meant in south africa shut
00:54:03.750 || 00:54:03.760 || down for the first time in its 60-year
00:54:05.910 || 00:54:05.920 || or 70-year history and ran out of
00:54:08.309 || 00:54:08.319 || product one wealthy swiss businessman
00:54:10.390 || 00:54:10.400 || flew his own 747 there and cleaned him
00:54:12.390 || 00:54:12.400 || out the perth mint shut down in july or
00:54:14.870 || 00:54:14.880 || august of that year the canadian and the
00:54:16.870 || 00:54:16.880 || austrian mint were working you know
00:54:19.190 || 00:54:19.200 || eight hour uh three eight hour shifts 24
00:54:21.190 || 00:54:21.200 || hours a day and they were you know as
00:54:22.630 || 00:54:22.640 || much as uh
00:54:25.510 || 00:54:25.520 || uh you know four or five months backward
00:54:27.750 || 00:54:27.760 || the u.s mint was shut down uh eight
00:54:30.470 || 00:54:30.480 || seven or eight times in 2008 and
00:54:33.510 || 00:54:33.520 || everything was when they finally opened
00:54:35.670 || 00:54:35.680 || back up when they finally opened back up
00:54:38.150 || 00:54:38.160 || in 2000 or towards the end of the year
00:54:39.990 || 00:54:40.000 || rather when they finally opened back up
00:54:41.670 || 00:54:41.680 || the few mints that did it was a hundred
00:54:43.990 || 00:54:44.000 || percent premium with nine dollar silver
00:54:45.430 || 00:54:45.440 || you'd pay 18
00:54:47.349 || 00:54:47.359 || for silver eagles and silver maple leafs
00:54:49.670 || 00:54:49.680 || but there was an extended period of time
00:54:52.309 || 00:54:52.319 || where we couldn't get anything so the
00:54:56.069 || 00:54:56.079 || price was cratering by 60 and silver and
00:54:58.630 || 00:54:58.640 || 30 plus percent in gold you would think
00:55:00.150 || 00:55:00.160 || that everyone dumped everything that
00:55:02.230 || 00:55:02.240 || they had onto the marketplace but it was
00:55:04.230 || 00:55:04.240 || the opposite of that the price was
00:55:05.829 || 00:55:05.839 || driven down and the physicals were
00:55:08.309 || 00:55:08.319 || gobbled up in a matter of days and i
00:55:09.829 || 00:55:09.839 || thought i was going out of business i
00:55:12.069 || 00:55:12.079 || truly did i could not get anything i've
00:55:13.990 || 00:55:14.000 || talked about this before david morgan
00:55:16.549 || 00:55:16.559 || rescued the entire industry david called
00:55:19.190 || 00:55:19.200 || me and he said andy you know i got these
00:55:21.430 || 00:55:21.440 || friends in washington who um
00:55:23.270 || 00:55:23.280 || they their company called pyromet
00:55:25.030 || 00:55:25.040 || they've been recycling silver out of
00:55:26.549 || 00:55:26.559 || x-ray machines for 30 years they have
00:55:28.150 || 00:55:28.160 || this massive stockpile of silver they
00:55:30.470 || 00:55:30.480 || want to capitalize on the fact that
00:55:32.390 || 00:55:32.400 || there's no product and they made these
00:55:35.030 || 00:55:35.040 || horribly ugly bars that just said 100
00:55:37.270 || 00:55:37.280 || ounces and they didn't even say 100
00:55:40.230 || 00:55:40.240 || ounces of what and and so you know if it
00:55:41.589 || 00:55:41.599 || weren't for david there would have been
00:55:43.510 || 00:55:43.520 || nothing but the point of it is with the
00:55:45.430 || 00:55:45.440 || price getting creamed
00:55:47.030 || 00:55:47.040 || all the product disappeared and when
00:55:49.030 || 00:55:49.040 || they finally said okay we'll take your
00:55:51.349 || 00:55:51.359 || order the u.s and the canadian input
00:55:52.710 || 00:55:52.720 || you're going to have to pay up front you
00:55:54.230 || 00:55:54.240 || won't get your product for up to eight
00:55:58.230 || 00:55:58.240 || weeks it was at 100 premium 100
00:56:00.950 || 00:56:00.960 || 9 silver you're paying 17 or 18 bucks to
00:56:02.549 || 00:56:02.559 || get it so
00:56:05.670 || 00:56:05.680 || yeah i think it it has it has shown look
00:56:07.829 || 00:56:07.839 || if it falls by a dollar or two and stays
00:56:09.589 || 00:56:09.599 || there for a while sure premiums may come
00:56:12.630 || 00:56:12.640 || down but if you see a substantive drop
00:56:13.430 || 00:56:13.440 || in
00:56:14.390 || 00:56:14.400 || um
00:56:17.030 || 00:56:17.040 || in the price of of metals then yeah i i
00:56:19.430 || 00:56:19.440 || think and i don't expect that to happen
00:56:22.390 || 00:56:22.400 || but if you do see that um yeah you'll
00:56:25.030 || 00:56:25.040 || see premiums go to the moon look we've
00:56:26.630 || 00:56:26.640 || all been told that there's this
00:56:28.710 || 00:56:28.720 || narrative that when markets collapse
00:56:30.150 || 00:56:30.160 || they throw out the baby with the bath
00:56:33.270 || 00:56:33.280 || water and they they drive down the the
00:56:36.230 || 00:56:36.240 || price uh of or everyone sells their
00:56:38.230 || 00:56:38.240 || metals to pay off margin debt or total
00:56:39.910 || 00:56:39.920 || sell everything moment yeah
00:56:42.230 || 00:56:42.240 || i don't believe that i never have i i
00:56:44.630 || 00:56:44.640 || think it's it's more damage controlled
00:56:45.829 || 00:56:45.839 || by the same
00:56:47.750 || 00:56:47.760 || cartel that's been suppressing the price
00:56:49.990 || 00:56:50.000 || forever because they want to de-link the
00:56:52.069 || 00:56:52.079 || rationale that people have because i'll
00:56:53.910 || 00:56:53.920 || tell you what when that happens when
00:56:56.470 || 00:56:56.480 || those when that price gets clobbered we
00:57:00.150 || 00:57:00.160 || don't have one person selling one ounce
00:57:02.870 || 00:57:02.880 || ever that's the opposite of that so if
00:57:05.270 || 00:57:05.280 || you believe that that this is all done
00:57:07.670 || 00:57:07.680 || on on the exchanges that you know these
00:57:10.069 || 00:57:10.079 || big these big holders of metal are
00:57:12.710 || 00:57:12.720 || selling everything to come up with cash
00:57:14.549 || 00:57:14.559 || to cover their cratering equity
00:57:17.190 || 00:57:17.200 || portfolio as well i don't i think it's a
00:57:18.950 || 00:57:18.960 || bunch of hogwash quite to the contrary
00:57:20.230 || 00:57:20.240 || that would be the time they'd be going
00:57:23.829 || 00:57:23.839 || the other direction so i think it's um
00:57:25.990 || 00:57:26.000 || it's about damage control and it's
00:57:27.829 || 00:57:27.839 || getting to the point when you look at
00:57:30.390 || 00:57:30.400 || the fact that right now let me just find
00:57:32.950 || 00:57:32.960 || this number here real quick
00:57:36.789 || 00:57:36.799 || right now on comex if i can
00:57:40.069 || 00:57:40.079 || the open interest for silver on comex is
00:57:42.710 || 00:57:42.720 || one thousand five hundred percent of the
00:57:44.549 || 00:57:44.559 || registered category
00:57:46.630 || 00:57:46.640 || one thousand five hundred percent of the
00:57:49.430 || 00:57:49.440 || registered category that means that
00:57:50.789 || 00:57:50.799 || if
00:57:52.390 || 00:57:52.400 || virtually no one would get their
00:57:55.030 || 00:57:55.040 || physical silver if they tried to get it
00:57:58.069 || 00:57:58.079 || because it has been rehypothecated
00:58:00.630 || 00:58:00.640 || by a factor of 1500
00:58:02.789 || 00:58:02.799 || and so you're looking at a situation
00:58:05.430 || 00:58:05.440 || where you know um
00:58:07.829 || 00:58:07.839 || it'll it just this is not what's
00:58:10.150 || 00:58:10.160 || happening it is not about
00:58:11.750 || 00:58:11.760 || people selling metal it's about
00:58:13.670 || 00:58:13.680 || contracts on the comex market
00:58:15.990 || 00:58:16.000 || controlling the paper price and that's
00:58:17.829 || 00:58:17.839 || what i wanted to drive down the price on
00:58:20.230 || 00:58:20.240 || comex but when that happens the smart
00:58:22.390 || 00:58:22.400 || people all around the world
00:58:24.069 || 00:58:24.079 || start gobbling up all the physical
00:58:26.150 || 00:58:26.160 || because they know it's a scam so here's
00:58:28.150 || 00:58:28.160 || what i wanted to drill in on this is
00:58:30.309 || 00:58:30.319 || i've been speaking with couple after
00:58:32.470 || 00:58:32.480 || couple after couple after couple for
00:58:33.589 || 00:58:33.599 || over
00:58:35.589 || 00:58:35.599 || two months now and everybody's talking
00:58:38.470 || 00:58:38.480 || about sometime in september october
00:58:40.069 || 00:58:40.079 || in you know late third quarter early
00:58:41.670 || 00:58:41.680 || fourth quarter there's going to be this
00:58:42.950 || 00:58:42.960 || big bad thing that's going to happen
00:58:43.910 || 00:58:43.920 || everybody's talking about there's going
00:58:45.829 || 00:58:45.839 || to be this big event it's going to drive
00:58:47.510 || 00:58:47.520 || down all the markets and that's when i'm
00:58:48.549 || 00:58:48.559 || going to make my move and that's when
00:58:49.589 || 00:58:49.599 || i'm going to get my silver because i'm
00:58:51.510 || 00:58:51.520 || going to nab that that that low price
00:58:52.789 || 00:58:52.799 || and that's going to make up for the fact
00:58:56.150 || 00:58:56.160 || that my my my stocks are down by 40 on
00:58:57.910 || 00:58:57.920 || the year whatever it is
00:59:00.549 || 00:59:00.559 || and i'm really seriously concerned about
00:59:02.309 || 00:59:02.319 || those people you've talked to us for
00:59:03.589 || 00:59:03.599 || years about how it's less than half a
00:59:04.950 || 00:59:04.960 || percent rick rule has talked to us about
00:59:06.470 || 00:59:06.480 || how it's less than half a percent of the
00:59:08.950 || 00:59:08.960 || families that's not okay with me for the
00:59:11.349 || 00:59:11.359 || week to have 99.5 of the families in our
00:59:13.670 || 00:59:13.680 || community in our state in our country
00:59:15.510 || 00:59:15.520 || that are that exposed that have no
00:59:16.549 || 00:59:16.559 || shelter
00:59:19.750 || 00:59:19.760 || to go to to to protect themselves and
00:59:21.430 || 00:59:21.440 || that if so many of these people are
00:59:22.950 || 00:59:22.960 || thinking they're going to wait for this
00:59:25.430 || 00:59:25.440 || crash moment and then just scoop up like
00:59:26.870 || 00:59:26.880 || you're just going to rush in on a black
00:59:28.789 || 00:59:28.799 || friday and just get all those all those
00:59:30.230 || 00:59:30.240 || tickami elmo dolls because it's not
00:59:33.030 || 00:59:33.040 || going to be any any mad mass of people
00:59:34.069 || 00:59:34.079 || trying to press through those little
00:59:36.710 || 00:59:36.720 || doors of the store and get in there
00:59:39.190 || 00:59:39.200 || can you talk about reality about what's
00:59:41.190 || 00:59:41.200 || going to happen i mean i guess last week
00:59:42.549 || 00:59:42.559 || your the name the title of your video
00:59:44.230 || 00:59:44.240 || was the public will be shut out so i
00:59:45.829 || 00:59:45.839 || guess that that summarizes it it's not
00:59:47.349 || 00:59:47.359 || it's just being naive it's being
00:59:49.589 || 00:59:49.599 || completely naive you know it's it's
00:59:51.589 || 00:59:51.599 || hurricane season here in florida right
00:59:53.670 || 00:59:53.680 || now and you know what do you wait until
00:59:56.549 || 00:59:56.559 || there's a storm in in in uh right off
00:59:58.870 || 00:59:58.880 || the coast of florida before you buy
01:00:01.270 || 01:00:01.280 || you know homeowners insurance and
01:00:03.030 || 01:00:03.040 || no i think that
01:00:05.270 || 01:00:05.280 || we're well past that that would be for
01:00:06.950 || 01:00:06.960 || the person who
01:00:09.589 || 01:00:09.599 || already has a nice you know position in
01:00:12.870 || 01:00:12.880 || metals and and maybe can scoop it up
01:00:14.549 || 01:00:14.559 || right away because there's a very short
01:00:16.390 || 01:00:16.400 || window when the price drops before the
01:00:18.870 || 01:00:18.880 || premiums rise because everything gets
01:00:21.109 || 01:00:21.119 || gobbled up sure but for someone who
01:00:22.870 || 01:00:22.880 || doesn't have a position at all who's
01:00:24.950 || 01:00:24.960 || waiting for that is is just
01:00:27.190 || 01:00:27.200 || very naive and is making a massive
01:00:29.829 || 01:00:29.839 || mistake and you know dunnigan
01:00:32.150 || 01:00:32.160 || um i'm sorry i got this puppy i don't
01:00:33.829 || 01:00:33.839 || know if you can hear it but i got a
01:00:36.069 || 01:00:36.079 || puppy who thinks he's a roadrunner and i
01:00:38.309 || 01:00:38.319 || have wood floors and i hear him coming
01:00:39.990 || 01:00:40.000 || down the hall and comes into my office
01:00:41.910 || 01:00:41.920 || and slides from here at about 90 miles
01:00:44.069 || 01:00:44.079 || an hour so i apologize if there's no
01:00:44.950 || 01:00:44.960 || worries
01:00:47.430 || 01:00:47.440 || no ways we all we all have our our uh
01:00:48.710 || 01:00:48.720 || furry friends
01:00:51.750 || 01:00:51.760 || it's like he's uh like he ate a pound of
01:00:54.230 || 01:00:54.240 || coffee i don't know anyway so the bottom
01:00:57.270 || 01:00:57.280 || line is yeah i don't i don't think that
01:00:59.990 || 01:01:00.000 || that's a wise move whatsoever in fact i
01:01:01.589 || 01:01:01.599 || think it's about the worst possible
01:01:04.230 || 01:01:04.240 || decision one could make um and it just
01:01:05.589 || 01:01:05.599 || goes to show that they don't understand
01:01:07.270 || 01:01:07.280 || this industry and one of the things that
01:01:08.630 || 01:01:08.640 || i struggle with
01:01:10.789 || 01:01:10.799 || so hard and i probably shouldn't i
01:01:13.589 || 01:01:13.599 || should just stop beating myself up i try
01:01:16.549 || 01:01:16.559 || so hard to be so genuine and i can see
01:01:18.549 || 01:01:18.559 || why people would think he's full of crap
01:01:20.710 || 01:01:20.720 || you know he just wants to push people
01:01:22.470 || 01:01:22.480 || you know through the cash register
01:01:24.390 || 01:01:24.400 || that's really not it not even a little
01:01:26.870 || 01:01:26.880 || bit i try to be honest and that that
01:01:28.950 || 01:01:28.960 || honesty would center around like
01:01:30.470 || 01:01:30.480 || everything you've ever talked about
01:01:32.870 || 01:01:32.880 || since you've been on youtube preparing
01:01:35.430 || 01:01:35.440 || preparing before these things happen
01:01:37.430 || 01:01:37.440 || you can't do it that way you'll you'll
01:01:39.829 || 01:01:39.839 || get clobbered you can't do it that way
01:01:42.870 || 01:01:42.880 || you won't get your product um
01:01:45.190 || 01:01:45.200 || and who knows how big of an event this
01:01:47.190 || 01:01:47.200 || will be you know
01:01:49.589 || 01:01:49.599 || why did they impose bail-in and gating
01:01:51.670 || 01:01:51.680 || legislation do they think something
01:01:53.349 || 01:01:53.359 || really big will happen maybe you get
01:01:55.109 || 01:01:55.119 || locked out of your bank for a while
01:01:57.829 || 01:01:57.839 || maybe you get uh maybe you get
01:01:59.270 || 01:01:59.280 || locked out of your money market you
01:02:01.270 || 01:02:01.280 || can't pull your funds out because it's
01:02:04.150 || 01:02:04.160 || gated you know i think that one of these
01:02:06.390 || 01:02:06.400 || days um
01:02:07.510 || 01:02:07.520 || you know
01:02:08.950 || 01:02:08.960 || there's going to be an event and maybe
01:02:10.789 || 01:02:10.799 || it's a major major market sell-off
01:02:12.870 || 01:02:12.880 || that's going to create a lot of problems
01:02:15.030 || 01:02:15.040 || i remember in
01:02:16.710 || 01:02:16.720 || 2020
01:02:19.190 || 01:02:19.200 || i told my nephew to call fidelity and
01:02:21.190 || 01:02:21.200 || sit in the sidelines he works for a big
01:02:23.270 || 01:02:23.280 || company has a 401k
01:02:25.270 || 01:02:25.280 || called on a thursday right after things
01:02:27.190 || 01:02:27.200 || started to get freaky and the market
01:02:29.349 || 01:02:29.359 || started selling off and he waited on
01:02:32.069 || 01:02:32.079 || hold for two and a half hours and then
01:02:34.150 || 01:02:34.160 || an agent came on said look we we we
01:02:36.230 || 01:02:36.240 || can't get to you today let's book an
01:02:38.309 || 01:02:38.319 || appointment for you on tuesday
01:02:39.990 || 01:02:40.000 || so you know
01:02:41.430 || 01:02:41.440 || when everyone is running through the
01:02:43.829 || 01:02:43.839 || turnstile at once it's not a good plan
01:02:45.589 || 01:02:45.599 || and i think you need to develop a core
01:02:48.309 || 01:02:48.319 || position immediately and and once you
01:02:50.230 || 01:02:50.240 || develop a core position then you have
01:02:53.829 || 01:02:53.839 || the liberty to to cost average and pick
01:02:56.710 || 01:02:56.720 || and choose it's like buying a a shotgun
01:02:58.950 || 01:02:58.960 || for family protection and waiting for
01:03:00.950 || 01:03:00.960 || the bullets to go on sale no you buy a
01:03:02.390 || 01:03:02.400 || box of bullets and then if you want to
01:03:03.510 || 01:03:03.520 || buy more
01:03:05.750 || 01:03:05.760 || when they go on sale fine but to do it
01:03:07.750 || 01:03:07.760 || inverse of that is just
01:03:09.990 || 01:03:10.000 || is foolhardy it's not you know right as
01:03:11.589 || 01:03:11.599 || you're slamming into a car you're not
01:03:13.670 || 01:03:13.680 || calling your you know your geico agent
01:03:16.230 || 01:03:16.240 || hey i need car insurance no it's you
01:03:17.750 || 01:03:17.760 || better do it before you get in the car
01:03:20.710 || 01:03:20.720 || and that's the exact same thing here
01:03:22.870 || 01:03:22.880 || uh it's a bad mistake to wait for that
01:03:25.270 || 01:03:25.280 || and i really do believe that
01:03:27.910 || 01:03:27.920 || one of these days they that won't happen
01:03:29.670 || 01:03:29.680 || because when you see the commercial
01:03:31.829 || 01:03:31.839 || banks net long right now
01:03:33.589 || 01:03:33.599 || which i've never seen before they're
01:03:36.549 || 01:03:36.559 || positioned to not come in and squash the
01:03:38.630 || 01:03:38.640 || rally let's talk about this for one
01:03:39.510 || 01:03:39.520 || second
01:03:41.109 || 01:03:41.119 || what makes the commercial bank
01:03:43.750 || 01:03:43.760 || manipulation so unusual is that they
01:03:46.309 || 01:03:46.319 || always short a rising market
01:03:48.390 || 01:03:48.400 || most people who showed a market short of
01:03:50.390 || 01:03:50.400 || falling market it's fallen short and
01:03:52.390 || 01:03:52.400 || step on it more step on it some more the
01:03:54.309 || 01:03:54.319 || price goes down to think amc and
01:03:55.510 || 01:03:55.520 || gamestop
01:03:58.390 || 01:03:58.400 || you better have a massive checkbook and
01:04:01.190 || 01:04:01.200 || you better have a lot of intel to short
01:04:04.549 || 01:04:04.559 || a rising market one that has the
01:04:06.470 || 01:04:06.480 || fundamentals behind it that this one
01:04:08.390 || 01:04:08.400 || does well that is exactly what the
01:04:11.270 || 01:04:11.280 || commercial banks always have had and
01:04:13.190 || 01:04:13.200 || what they have always done they sucker
01:04:15.190 || 01:04:15.200 || in the speculation the price rises and
01:04:17.589 || 01:04:17.599 || they short it so much so that it loses
01:04:19.910 || 01:04:19.920 || momentum and goes the other way but
01:04:22.710 || 01:04:22.720 || they've never been positioned that long
01:04:25.270 || 01:04:25.280 || so what happens if this time they stand
01:04:27.670 || 01:04:27.680 || back and it's instead of going short
01:04:29.910 || 01:04:29.920 || they buy more lawns
01:04:31.270 || 01:04:31.280 || what happens if they just don't do
01:04:33.029 || 01:04:33.039 || anything and let the momentum of the
01:04:36.069 || 01:04:36.079 || market rise and this massive massive
01:04:38.470 || 01:04:38.480 || massive managed money short position
01:04:40.710 || 01:04:40.720 || starts getting squeezed and they have to
01:04:43.029 || 01:04:43.039 || cover and the managed money does not
01:04:44.950 || 01:04:44.960 || have pain threshold
01:04:46.630 || 01:04:46.640 || they need to cover they need to answer
01:04:50.230 || 01:04:50.240 || to their to their uh to their investors
01:04:51.670 || 01:04:51.680 || so they're going to get out as fast as
01:04:53.270 || 01:04:53.280 || they can and i think that's probably
01:04:55.270 || 01:04:55.280 || what you saw yesterday with silver
01:04:57.349 || 01:04:57.359 || moving up a dollar was a little bit of a
01:04:58.870 || 01:04:58.880 || short squeeze where
01:05:01.109 || 01:05:01.119 || maybe one of these managed money traders
01:05:03.670 || 01:05:03.680 || started to cover their shorts and pop up
01:05:06.630 || 01:05:06.640 || go silver buy a dollar well what if it's
01:05:09.270 || 01:05:09.280 || half a dozen of them silver up six bucks
01:05:11.270 || 01:05:11.280 || seven bucks eight bucks and what does
01:05:12.950 || 01:05:12.960 || that do to all the other shorts that
01:05:15.270 || 01:05:15.280 || we're getting squeezed and and maybe
01:05:17.349 || 01:05:17.359 || this time the managed money gets
01:05:18.870 || 01:05:18.880 || squeezed and the
01:05:21.109 || 01:05:21.119 || the commercial banks don't come in and
01:05:23.190 || 01:05:23.200 || short the market to drive the price down
01:05:23.990 || 01:05:24.000 || again
01:05:25.670 || 01:05:25.680 || that's what they've done all these years
01:05:27.829 || 01:05:27.839 || they rinse wash and repeat they suck in
01:05:30.069 || 01:05:30.079 || the speculators they let it rise then
01:05:32.950 || 01:05:32.960 || they sell all the the options expire
01:05:34.069 || 01:05:34.079 || worthless
01:05:35.829 || 01:05:35.839 || they come back in and do it all over
01:05:37.910 || 01:05:37.920 || again over and over and over the manage
01:05:39.910 || 01:05:39.920 || money are brain dead they keep doing the
01:05:42.789 || 01:05:42.799 || same thing but this time it's like the
01:05:44.950 || 01:05:44.960 || managed money capitulated and this is
01:05:47.029 || 01:05:47.039 || what we were talking about coinciding
01:05:49.510 || 01:05:49.520 || with the nickel market failure in the in
01:05:51.670 || 01:05:51.680 || on the lme maybe this time the
01:05:53.270 || 01:05:53.280 || management said i'm out we're out we're
01:05:55.270 || 01:05:55.280 || done we're short we're then in fact
01:05:56.470 || 01:05:56.480 || we're not going to just sell we're going
01:05:59.190 || 01:05:59.200 || to go short it's exactly what the
01:06:01.430 || 01:06:01.440 || commercial banks wanted allowing them to
01:06:03.990 || 01:06:04.000 || cover all their old short positions and
01:06:06.150 || 01:06:06.160 || now they've repositioned long if you
01:06:08.870 || 01:06:08.880 || don't see this as a massive massive
01:06:12.069 || 01:06:12.079 || bullish environment you never will
01:06:14.470 || 01:06:14.480 || the question becomes will they stand
01:06:16.230 || 01:06:16.240 || back when the price starts to spike
01:06:18.390 || 01:06:18.400 || higher one of these days they will i've
01:06:19.750 || 01:06:19.760 || always said they'll make more to the
01:06:21.670 || 01:06:21.680 || upside than they ever did to the down
01:06:23.589 || 01:06:23.599 || and when you look at
01:06:26.470 || 01:06:26.480 || them doing this it will allow them to
01:06:29.750 || 01:06:29.760 || to not get heat by the regulators for
01:06:31.349 || 01:06:31.359 || suppressing the markets because hey
01:06:34.390 || 01:06:34.400 || they're actually net long and you know
01:06:35.829 || 01:06:35.839 || all of us have been screaming for the
01:06:37.829 || 01:06:37.839 || last decade why aren't the regulators
01:06:40.870 || 01:06:40.880 || doing anything about this you know very
01:06:43.109 || 01:06:43.119 || very concentrated manipulative short
01:06:45.270 || 01:06:45.280 || position and now
01:06:47.349 || 01:06:47.359 || ain't the case in fact right now
01:06:50.789 || 01:06:50.799 || as a group they're net long over 5100
01:06:53.029 || 01:06:53.039 || contracts in silver that's 25 million
01:06:54.390 || 01:06:54.400 || ounces so
01:06:55.430 || 01:06:55.440 || um
01:06:59.510 || 01:06:59.520 || not a lot yet but well it is but not um
01:07:02.470 || 01:07:02.480 || i think it's uh it's very interesting to
01:07:04.470 || 01:07:04.480 || contemplate will they not short the
01:07:06.309 || 01:07:06.319 || rising market this time
01:07:08.230 || 01:07:08.240 || and maybe the answer is yes maybe they
01:07:10.150 || 01:07:10.160 || are positioned to ride this out why
01:07:12.549 || 01:07:12.559 || would jp morgan according to ted butler
01:07:15.109 || 01:07:15.119 || a mass 1.1 billion ounces of physical
01:07:17.029 || 01:07:17.039 || silver and 45 million ounces of gold
01:07:18.870 || 01:07:18.880 || just for the hell of it or do they think
01:07:21.510 || 01:07:21.520 || ultimately the price rises why is jp
01:07:23.270 || 01:07:23.280 || morgan been that long in the futures
01:07:25.349 || 01:07:25.359 || market for a while now
01:07:27.029 || 01:07:27.039 || why are the commercial banks and the
01:07:29.510 || 01:07:29.520 || commercials as a group net long right
01:07:31.349 || 01:07:31.359 || now while the managed money
01:07:33.190 || 01:07:33.200 || is way short
01:07:35.430 || 01:07:35.440 || we're close and one of these days one of
01:07:38.069 || 01:07:38.079 || these days the end of the story comes
01:07:40.950 || 01:07:40.960 || and the wolf comes and the little boy me
01:07:43.190 || 01:07:43.200 || who's been crying wolf forever won't be
01:07:45.349 || 01:07:45.359 || there saying i told you so will just be
01:07:46.549 || 01:07:46.559 || i wish you would have listened to me
01:07:48.390 || 01:07:48.400 || because it was right there in front of
01:07:49.270 || 01:07:49.280 || you
01:07:50.789 || 01:07:50.799 || and um
01:07:52.309 || 01:07:52.319 || you know this is one of these deals
01:07:54.069 || 01:07:54.079 || where if you're right just once it'll be
01:07:55.990 || 01:07:56.000 || it'll be a massive life-changing
01:07:59.029 || 01:07:59.039 || experience it'll be a game changer so
01:08:01.190 || 01:08:01.200 || better to be right once when it matters
01:08:03.109 || 01:08:03.119 || than to be wrong several other times
01:08:03.910 || 01:08:03.920 || when
01:08:06.150 || 01:08:06.160 || you know and i have been wrong i've been
01:08:07.589 || 01:08:07.599 || wrong because the commercial banks
01:08:09.510 || 01:08:09.520 || manipulate the market the fundamentals
01:08:11.190 || 01:08:11.200 || by which i gauge
01:08:13.109 || 01:08:13.119 || my opinions have been right and
01:08:15.670 || 01:08:15.680 || ultimately they're rooted in mathematics
01:08:17.829 || 01:08:17.839 || and in economics and in logic and those
01:08:19.829 || 01:08:19.839 || things win out in the end
01:08:22.229 || 01:08:22.239 || in the end the little boy sees the wolf
01:08:24.550 || 01:08:24.560 || in the end mathematic wins in the end
01:08:27.030 || 01:08:27.040 || mother nature wins and and i think we're
01:08:29.669 || 01:08:29.679 || getting closer to that final chapter and
01:08:33.030 || 01:08:33.040 || the new book is the wealth goes eastward
01:08:34.789 || 01:08:34.799 || and chapter one will be the brics
01:08:36.950 || 01:08:36.960 || nations institute a new global reserve
01:08:39.669 || 01:08:39.679 || currency pegged to gold that if i had to
01:08:41.910 || 01:08:41.920 || guess that person who called me moses
01:08:43.510 || 01:08:43.520 || with the tablets
01:08:45.749 || 01:08:45.759 || the third tablet that broke well that's
01:08:48.229 || 01:08:48.239 || the tablet right there that is talking
01:08:49.590 || 01:08:49.600 || about
01:08:51.510 || 01:08:51.520 || what's coming next and i really do
01:08:53.510 || 01:08:53.520 || believe that is the brics nations and
01:08:55.910 || 01:08:55.920 || this coalition of the east move against
01:08:58.229 || 01:08:58.239 || the west and that's when things really
01:09:00.789 || 01:09:00.799 || start to come into focus maybe this is
01:09:02.709 || 01:09:02.719 || why the big money is taking
01:09:05.990 || 01:09:06.000 || record record record possession of metal
01:09:08.309 || 01:09:08.319 || off of all of the exchanges the shanghai
01:09:10.229 || 01:09:10.239 || gold exchange the london metals exchange
01:09:12.789 || 01:09:12.799 || the comex and over 100 million ounces
01:09:14.149 || 01:09:14.159 || backdoored by the authorized
01:09:16.709 || 01:09:16.719 || participants on slv in the last four
01:09:19.990 || 01:09:20.000 || months this is this is very real
01:09:23.110 || 01:09:23.120 || speaking of uh mother nature and uh the
01:09:24.550 || 01:09:24.560 || mathematics catching up with us i see
