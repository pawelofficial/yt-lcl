00:01:24.770 || 00:01:24.780 || grateful that we've had these weekly
00:01:26.570 || 00:01:26.580 || Market updates all year if people are
00:01:28.429 || 00:01:28.439 || wondering about my background here we're
00:01:32.570 || 00:01:32.580 || at a hotel near the rim of the Grand
00:01:35.330 || 00:01:35.340 || Canyon on our way home from visiting
00:01:36.730 || 00:01:36.740 || children and grandchildren in Arizona
00:01:40.429 || 00:01:40.439 || and I noticed one of the questions that
00:01:43.130 || 00:01:43.140 || was asked Andy people are really getting
00:01:45.050 || 00:01:45.060 || concerned more than ever before I think
00:01:47.210 || 00:01:47.220 || about the potential of government
00:01:49.130 || 00:01:49.140 || nationalization or confiscation I know
00:01:50.450 || 00:01:50.460 || we talked about that a little bit in the
00:01:53.929 || 00:01:53.939 || past but people are wondering if you are
00:01:58.010 || 00:01:58.020 || aware of any strategic differences in
00:02:00.889 || 00:02:00.899 || from security standpoint between storage
00:02:05.090 || 00:02:05.100 || locations located either in Utah or
00:02:08.210 || 00:02:08.220 || Minnesota excuse me uh South Dakota or
00:02:11.029 || 00:02:11.039 || Florida when it comes to that question
00:02:13.369 || 00:02:13.379 || of nationalism potential nationalization
00:02:16.089 || 00:02:16.099 || in the future or are we all grasping it
00:02:17.809 || 00:02:17.819 || hypotheticals because we really don't
00:02:20.330 || 00:02:20.340 || know what hijinks the government might
00:02:21.650 || 00:02:21.660 || play in the future and we're trying to
00:02:23.390 || 00:02:23.400 || do it best we can
00:02:24.949 || 00:02:24.959 || well yeah I mean look I always think
00:02:27.110 || 00:02:27.120 || it's best first of all that's good to be
00:02:29.449 || 00:02:29.459 || here of course as usual and and I love
00:02:33.650 || 00:02:33.660 || our Tuesdays together it's like uh it's
00:02:34.970 || 00:02:34.980 || something that I look very forward to
00:02:36.650 || 00:02:36.660 || every week so anyway it's good to be
00:02:39.770 || 00:02:39.780 || here and yeah look it's always best done
00:02:43.369 || 00:02:43.379 || again to hold your medal yourself to you
00:02:45.290 || 00:02:45.300 || know to be your own Vault to be a
00:02:46.970 || 00:02:46.980 || midnight Gardener burying it in your
00:02:49.729 || 00:02:49.739 || backyard to hide it wherever you see fit
00:02:52.790 || 00:02:52.800 || when you talk about storing it in a
00:02:55.369 || 00:02:55.379 || vault or nationalization I mean I love a
00:02:57.050 || 00:02:57.060 || desperate governments do desperate
00:02:59.809 || 00:02:59.819 || things it's easy to let your mind wander
00:03:03.890 || 00:03:03.900 || to the recesses of that dark place sorry
00:03:05.809 || 00:03:05.819 || about that I have enough you guys
00:03:07.490 || 00:03:07.500 || different kind of technical difficulties
00:03:09.770 || 00:03:09.780 || there yeah yeah knock it off anyways
00:03:12.290 || 00:03:12.300 || look bottom line is this is that
00:03:15.290 || 00:03:15.300 || um I have often felt that that the
00:03:18.170 || 00:03:18.180 || nationalization of gold and silver the
00:03:20.990 || 00:03:21.000 || way that it was confiscated in 1933 is
00:03:23.990 || 00:03:24.000 || is really off the table at least in my
00:03:26.149 || 00:03:26.159 || mind it represents as we've talked about
00:03:29.570 || 00:03:29.580 || such a minuscule part of the entire
00:03:32.570 || 00:03:32.580 || asset picture here in the United States
00:03:36.530 || 00:03:36.540 || I'm so sorry I apologize knock it off
00:03:38.990 || 00:03:39.000 || anyways bottom line is I don't think
00:03:44.449 || 00:03:44.459 || that they would go into the uh
00:03:51.470 || 00:03:51.480 || sorry my wife to the rescue oh thank you
00:03:54.289 || 00:03:54.299 || anyways I uh I I wouldn't think that
00:03:56.570 || 00:03:56.580 || they would come into the vaults and
00:03:59.390 || 00:03:59.400 || nationalize assets nationalize precious
00:04:00.970 || 00:04:00.980 || metals for people
00:04:04.309 || 00:04:04.319 || when it represents such a minuscule part
00:04:07.550 || 00:04:07.560 || of the the asset allocation of of the
00:04:10.190 || 00:04:10.200 || entire Financial Matrix in 1933 when
00:04:12.530 || 00:04:12.540 || gold was confiscated just like the
00:04:14.270 || 00:04:14.280 || pictures behind me show that's the
00:04:16.009 || 00:04:16.019 || executive order back there in Roosevelt
00:04:18.189 || 00:04:18.199 || who confiscated gold when that happened
00:04:21.409 || 00:04:21.419 || gold and silver were integral parts of
00:04:24.230 || 00:04:24.240 || everyday life they were currency while
00:04:26.330 || 00:04:26.340 || they still may be legal tender if you're
00:04:28.850 || 00:04:28.860 || talking about the American Eagle uh or
00:04:31.010 || 00:04:31.020 || the Buffalo or the U.S minted coins
00:04:34.790 || 00:04:34.800 || they're not currency and so taking metal
00:04:37.070 || 00:04:37.080 || from the American public I think would
00:04:39.530 || 00:04:39.540 || be very counterproductive it would usher
00:04:43.070 || 00:04:43.080 || in unintended consequences where if our
00:04:44.629 || 00:04:44.639 || creditors feared that type of
00:04:46.670 || 00:04:46.680 || nationalization of assets I think you
00:04:50.090 || 00:04:50.100 || would see an all-out uh Deluge of
00:04:52.790 || 00:04:52.800 || dumping of dollars of U.S treasuries and
00:04:55.790 || 00:04:55.800 || a completely total loss of any semblance
00:04:59.150 || 00:04:59.160 || of trust that is still left look there
00:05:00.590 || 00:05:00.600 || are sometimes you have to hold in a
00:05:03.409 || 00:05:03.419 || depository like if it's in an IRA but
00:05:04.850 || 00:05:04.860 || one of the best parts of the precious
00:05:07.129 || 00:05:07.139 || metals Ira done again is the ability to
00:05:09.290 || 00:05:09.300 || take possession of it so the bottom line
00:05:12.110 || 00:05:12.120 || is simply this hold it yourself hope for
00:05:13.850 || 00:05:13.860 || the best prepare for the worst we
00:05:17.570 || 00:05:17.580 || represent but a very small as I'm often
00:05:19.010 || 00:05:19.020 || fond of saying the pimple on the
00:05:20.749 || 00:05:20.759 || elephant's rear end a very small
00:05:22.189 || 00:05:22.199 || minuscule
00:05:26.150 || 00:05:26.160 || piece of of of the asset picture those
00:05:27.830 || 00:05:27.840 || of us who own precious metals I think
00:05:31.550 || 00:05:31.560 || the unintended consequences would not be
00:05:34.189 || 00:05:34.199 || um worth a very small take that they
00:05:36.350 || 00:05:36.360 || would make if that ever happens it's
00:05:38.930 || 00:05:38.940 || basically checkmate at that point you
00:05:40.550 || 00:05:40.560 || have to wonder is it better to to
00:05:42.950 || 00:05:42.960 || operate within a black market than it is
00:05:46.010 || 00:05:46.020 || to acquiesce if things get that bad
00:05:48.590 || 00:05:48.600 || where the government is nationalizing
00:05:51.830 || 00:05:51.840 || assets directly from the U.S public so
00:05:54.590 || 00:05:54.600 || no I don't notice really any place
00:05:57.290 || 00:05:57.300 || better than the other I guess you could
00:06:00.110 || 00:06:00.120 || say if you're talking Geographics yeah
00:06:01.850 || 00:06:01.860 || maybe Salt Lake City or North Dakota
00:06:04.490 || 00:06:04.500 || would be better than the outskirts of
00:06:06.890 || 00:06:06.900 || the country on the on the uh you know on
00:06:09.650 || 00:06:09.660 || the two coasts to be in the center of
00:06:12.230 || 00:06:12.240 || the state but of the country but look if
00:06:14.810 || 00:06:14.820 || a decree is made a decree is made and
00:06:16.370 || 00:06:16.380 || let's just hope it doesn't come to that
00:06:19.730 || 00:06:19.740 || I've often uh thought about this and I
00:06:21.230 || 00:06:21.240 || really can't wrap my head around the
00:06:22.969 || 00:06:22.979 || fact that they would come in and and
00:06:24.950 || 00:06:24.960 || confiscate gold and silver from what
00:06:27.230 || 00:06:27.240 || would represent such a small small
00:06:30.110 || 00:06:30.120 || portion of the public so there's a
00:06:32.390 || 00:06:32.400 || question here about again on the on the
00:06:34.070 || 00:06:34.080 || theme of confiscation we're gonna we'll
00:06:35.570 || 00:06:35.580 || we'll beat this just long enough until
00:06:37.550 || 00:06:37.560 || we till we don't have to
00:06:40.070 || 00:06:40.080 || um does Andy believe uh that it's
00:06:42.290 || 00:06:42.300 || necessary to buy old coins for the sake
00:06:43.969 || 00:06:43.979 || of safety from confiscation Greg Austin
00:06:46.129 || 00:06:46.139 || says no real reason to buy old coins for
00:06:48.590 || 00:06:48.600 || the sake of safety from confiscation
00:06:51.409 || 00:06:51.419 || yeah I mean I buy old coins because I
00:06:53.870 || 00:06:53.880 || like them and I think the companies and
00:06:56.029 || 00:06:56.039 || there are a few out there with very very
00:06:59.450 || 00:06:59.460 || polished spokespeople and they they talk
00:07:02.090 || 00:07:02.100 || about confiscation being something that
00:07:04.969 || 00:07:04.979 || should be your singular priority when
00:07:06.590 || 00:07:06.600 || you're accumulating metal I think that
00:07:09.290 || 00:07:09.300 || that is disingenuine myself I I would
00:07:14.270 || 00:07:14.280 || not buy the pre-60 or the pre-33 gold
00:07:17.090 || 00:07:17.100 || simply based upon
00:07:20.689 || 00:07:20.699 || um the the confiscatory aspects of it
00:07:23.689 || 00:07:23.699 || look I buy the pre 33 gold because I
00:07:26.390 || 00:07:26.400 || love it in 2017 I was screaming to
00:07:28.010 || 00:07:28.020 || everyone who would listen to me on these
00:07:30.290 || 00:07:30.300 || podcasts if you own Gold Eagles trade
00:07:34.670 || 00:07:34.680 || them for pre-6 uh pre-33 gold coins you
00:07:37.309 || 00:07:37.319 || could trade a one ounce gold eagle in
00:07:39.469 || 00:07:39.479 || 2017 when no one was buying any gold
00:07:42.409 || 00:07:42.419 || straight up for an MS 63 20 Liberty and
00:07:44.330 || 00:07:44.340 || not lose any gold if never seen that
00:07:47.330 || 00:07:47.340 || before but the now we're at a period of
00:07:49.969 || 00:07:49.979 || time where the premiums make you have to
00:07:52.150 || 00:07:52.160 || you know think twice about it for me
00:07:55.189 || 00:07:55.199 || buying the pre-33 gold was more a
00:07:57.230 || 00:07:57.240 || function of something that I loved I
00:07:58.790 || 00:07:58.800 || mean a piece of History a piece of
00:08:00.529 || 00:08:00.539 || Americana
00:08:03.409 || 00:08:03.419 || um something that made people think for
00:08:05.089 || 00:08:05.099 || a moment like wow that that's pretty
00:08:07.909 || 00:08:07.919 || much incredible most people don't know
00:08:11.150 || 00:08:11.160 || that gold was money prior to 1933 heck
00:08:12.950 || 00:08:12.960 || there was just a poll done that 30
00:08:14.689 || 00:08:14.699 || percent of the country still thinks that
00:08:16.909 || 00:08:16.919 || the US dollar is backed by gold so most
00:08:19.070 || 00:08:19.080 || people didn't have never seen a gold
00:08:22.129 || 00:08:22.139 || coin let alone the pre-33 gold coin and
00:08:25.189 || 00:08:25.199 || when I started in this industry in 1990
00:08:27.770 || 00:08:27.780 || no one walked old bullion when you add
00:08:30.290 || 00:08:30.300 || gold at 300 bucks an ounce in a 20 gold
00:08:34.029 || 00:08:34.039 || piece at 350 an American Eagle at 320 or
00:08:36.889 || 00:08:36.899 || 325. no one bought Global and everyone
00:08:39.290 || 00:08:39.300 || bought the pre-33 it's what everyone
00:08:42.230 || 00:08:42.240 || owned it's what I own predominantly for
00:08:44.449 || 00:08:44.459 || the first 20 years of my career
00:08:46.570 || 00:08:46.580 || and then somewhere around
00:08:50.170 || 00:08:50.180 || 2007 2008 right before Obama took office
00:08:52.850 || 00:08:52.860 || the perceived threat of confiscation
00:08:55.370 || 00:08:55.380 || became so acute that the premiums on
00:08:59.090 || 00:08:59.100 || numismatics went parabolic and much like
00:09:01.009 || 00:09:01.019 || the gold to Silver ratio right now done
00:09:02.750 || 00:09:02.760 || again what has defined the biggest
00:09:05.449 || 00:09:05.459 || trades of my career is identifying and
00:09:08.329 || 00:09:08.339 || exploiting price anomalies when we were
00:09:11.690 || 00:09:11.700 || seeing a 60 70 80 premium on common date
00:09:15.350 || 00:09:15.360 || Ms 62 three four coins I told everyone
00:09:17.449 || 00:09:17.459 || that would listen to me you need to sell
00:09:18.829 || 00:09:18.839 || your numismatics and go back into
00:09:20.449 || 00:09:20.459 || bullion and I flew all around the
00:09:22.130 || 00:09:22.140 || country for three years buying back
00:09:24.889 || 00:09:24.899 || everyone's numismatics selling it to the
00:09:28.670 || 00:09:28.680 || four or five auction galleries that I
00:09:30.949 || 00:09:30.959 || thought were as dumb as a dumb as a mud
00:09:32.930 || 00:09:32.940 || wall and it actually proved to be that
00:09:34.449 || 00:09:34.459 || way because the premiums collapsed
00:09:37.250 || 00:09:37.260 || anytime you see something so distorted
00:09:39.889 || 00:09:39.899 || in price anomaly or in price ratios it's
00:09:42.170 || 00:09:42.180 || an anomaly like the gold to Silver ratio
00:09:47.030 || 00:09:47.040 || like the numismatics were in 08 Now by
00:09:49.730 || 00:09:49.740 || 2017 they had come all the way down as
00:09:52.310 || 00:09:52.320 || as markets typically do in a pendulum
00:09:55.190 || 00:09:55.200 || they go from fair value to overvalue
00:09:57.110 || 00:09:57.120 || back through fair value to undervalued
00:09:59.030 || 00:09:59.040 || and I I would think we're kind of on the
00:10:01.190 || 00:10:01.200 || way back up again where I'm not going to
00:10:04.430 || 00:10:04.440 || buy these coins simply because I'm
00:10:06.350 || 00:10:06.360 || concerned about confiscation I think in
00:10:08.090 || 00:10:08.100 || the end it's about number of ounces that
00:10:10.070 || 00:10:10.080 || matter now when you were having some
00:10:12.889 || 00:10:12.899 || technical difficulties I was able to say
00:10:14.329 || 00:10:14.339 || hello to some of the people in the live
00:10:16.310 || 00:10:16.320 || chat I can't have it open on my computer
00:10:19.670 || 00:10:19.680 || screen because I hear you and I can't I
00:10:22.009 || 00:10:22.019 || hear both but one of the questions I saw
00:10:23.810 || 00:10:23.820 || was someone asking should I feel bad
00:10:25.550 || 00:10:25.560 || about buying silver eagles and junk
00:10:27.290 || 00:10:27.300 || silver look I've been consistent about
00:10:29.570 || 00:10:29.580 || this for a long time I was saying the
00:10:31.130 || 00:10:31.140 || same thing to you and everyone out there
00:10:32.870 || 00:10:32.880 || for the last two years don't buy them
00:10:35.630 || 00:10:35.640 || they're too expensive it's about number
00:10:38.449 || 00:10:38.459 || of ounces that matter now yes in the
00:10:40.310 || 00:10:40.320 || perfect world we buy American issue
00:10:42.949 || 00:10:42.959 || coins because a lot of people perceive
00:10:46.009 || 00:10:46.019 || the safety in American coins whether
00:10:48.410 || 00:10:48.420 || whether they be new or old against any
00:10:50.389 || 00:10:50.399 || type of governmental Shenanigans but
00:10:53.810 || 00:10:53.820 || here again in the end I have always felt
00:10:56.750 || 00:10:56.760 || they'll take the ETFs you have the the
00:10:58.970 || 00:10:58.980 || largest stockpile of silver in the world
00:11:00.829 || 00:11:00.839 || in the third or fourth largest stockpile
00:11:02.630 || 00:11:02.640 || of gold in the world and the ETF set
00:11:06.530 || 00:11:06.540 || being GLD and SLV held by HSBC Bank in
00:11:09.170 || 00:11:09.180 || the case of GLD and SLV is held by JP
00:11:11.090 || 00:11:11.100 || Morgan so you have the cartel crooked
00:11:13.610 || 00:11:13.620 || Banks managing these massive stockpiles
00:11:15.769 || 00:11:15.779 || of gold and silver that don't allow for
00:11:18.290 || 00:11:18.300 || all us common folk to take possession of
00:11:20.389 || 00:11:20.399 || the metal so they could close those two
00:11:22.610 || 00:11:22.620 || funds on a Friday night immediately
00:11:24.710 || 00:11:24.720 || transfer all of the money at the closing
00:11:27.290 || 00:11:27.300 || rate into your money market and look at
00:11:29.030 || 00:11:29.040 || the world and say what we didn't
00:11:30.949 || 00:11:30.959 || confiscate or activate eminent domain
00:11:33.110 || 00:11:33.120 || you're free to buy physical metal in
00:11:34.790 || 00:11:34.800 || this country we disclosed a couple of
00:11:36.710 || 00:11:36.720 || the ETFs which don't allow physical
00:11:39.350 || 00:11:39.360 || possession by you anyway it's a way for
00:11:40.850 || 00:11:40.860 || them to have their cake and eat it too
00:11:43.490 || 00:11:43.500 || without the global backlash I think
00:11:46.670 || 00:11:46.680 || here again we can all wonder what these
00:11:49.430 || 00:11:49.440 || uh you know you look at at
00:11:52.069 || 00:11:52.079 || um what's his name up north there uh in
00:11:54.410 || 00:11:54.420 || Canada who you know usurped the rule of
00:11:56.690 || 00:11:56.700 || law and due process and and froze
00:11:57.829 || 00:11:57.839 || people's accounts you look at
00:11:59.690 || 00:11:59.700 || governments who will do these things and
00:12:02.150 || 00:12:02.160 || you start to get scared I get it you
00:12:03.769 || 00:12:03.779 || know we're kind of on the Fringe just
00:12:05.750 || 00:12:05.760 || people who don't believe that the road
00:12:07.910 || 00:12:07.920 || to retirement is always paved with stock
00:12:09.530 || 00:12:09.540 || certificates and mutual funds and
00:12:12.470 || 00:12:12.480 || dollars and you wonder am I a Target you
00:12:13.970 || 00:12:13.980 || know look I think you're the pimple on
00:12:16.490 || 00:12:16.500 || the elephant you're unnoticed and for
00:12:17.930 || 00:12:17.940 || the government to come in and do that
00:12:20.630 || 00:12:20.640 || would really be a big statement to the
00:12:22.190 || 00:12:22.200 || world and I think one that they would
00:12:24.889 || 00:12:24.899 || not be eager to make unless they were
00:12:27.530 || 00:12:27.540 || completely and totally out of options
00:12:29.509 || 00:12:29.519 || we've got questions about the direction
00:12:31.370 || 00:12:31.380 || that premiums are heading you brought up
00:12:33.290 || 00:12:33.300 || how premiums have a life of their own
00:12:35.810 || 00:12:35.820 || sometimes numismatic premiums uh
00:12:38.569 || 00:12:38.579 || decouple from Boolean premiums the
00:12:40.250 || 00:12:40.260 || question is let me go back there right
00:12:43.129 || 00:12:43.139 || now uh the question is from Eric Hoffner
00:12:46.190 || 00:12:46.200 || Andy our premiums still going down yeah
00:12:48.410 || 00:12:48.420 || I've never seen anything like it and in
00:12:52.190 || 00:12:52.200 || in 30 years the the volatility in the
00:12:53.870 || 00:12:53.880 || premiums are extraordinary now let me
00:12:56.090 || 00:12:56.100 || caveat this
00:12:59.230 || 00:12:59.240 || um there's a whole field of
00:13:01.970 || 00:13:01.980 || economic theory it's called wave theory
00:13:04.610 || 00:13:04.620 || Elliott wave chondratic wave these are
00:13:07.970 || 00:13:07.980 || based upon human emotions and you know
00:13:10.430 || 00:13:10.440 || when I talk to people in the industry
00:13:11.870 || 00:13:11.880 || I've been doing this long enough where I
00:13:13.430 || 00:13:13.440 || have a lot of friends in the industry
00:13:17.030 || 00:13:17.040 || who are competitors but friends and um
00:13:19.610 || 00:13:19.620 || you know we talk a lot and the entire
00:13:22.790 || 00:13:22.800 || industry since really in the second week
00:13:25.490 || 00:13:25.500 || in November fell asleep and I attribute
00:13:27.590 || 00:13:27.600 || that honestly to the way that I look at
00:13:31.069 || 00:13:31.079 || the world myself being that you know I
00:13:32.810 || 00:13:32.820 || had my whole family and my wife's whole
00:13:35.750 || 00:13:35.760 || family here I had 25 people in my house
00:13:38.990 || 00:13:39.000 || for for Thanksgiving I had my wife's
00:13:41.269 || 00:13:41.279 || whole family like 11 people staying in
00:13:44.210 || 00:13:44.220 || our house over Thanksgiving and you know
00:13:47.090 || 00:13:47.100 || for two years they wouldn't come and I
00:13:48.829 || 00:13:48.839 || think there's something to that where
00:13:51.769 || 00:13:51.779 || people were just excited to get out to
00:13:54.170 || 00:13:54.180 || enjoy the holidays to watch football to
00:13:56.690 || 00:13:56.700 || have turkey and some beers and hang with
00:13:59.030 || 00:13:59.040 || their family to go on ski trips to do
00:14:00.650 || 00:14:00.660 || whatever ever the hell it is but not
00:14:03.590 || 00:14:03.600 || worry about covet outbreaks and I think
00:14:05.030 || 00:14:05.040 || that had something to do with people
00:14:07.009 || 00:14:07.019 || just unwinding and unplugging it's
00:14:09.470 || 00:14:09.480 || something that I've tried to do really
00:14:11.690 || 00:14:11.700 || since Thanksgiving and I've kind of done
00:14:12.710 || 00:14:12.720 || it
00:14:14.930 || 00:14:14.940 || um but I if it were me that's the way
00:14:16.490 || 00:14:16.500 || that I would look at things and I just
00:14:18.650 || 00:14:18.660 || want to unplug and forget and so the
00:14:21.530 || 00:14:21.540 || whole industry kind of relaxed now what
00:14:23.509 || 00:14:23.519 || that has done is allowed companies like
00:14:26.629 || 00:14:26.639 || me to stock up on product because it
00:14:28.790 || 00:14:28.800 || came at the exact same time as the new
00:14:31.069 || 00:14:31.079 || allocations come out and the big
00:14:34.370 || 00:14:34.380 || Distributors who have obligations to
00:14:36.949 || 00:14:36.959 || take massive allocations from The
00:14:39.530 || 00:14:39.540 || Sovereign mints are then going to fire
00:14:41.810 || 00:14:41.820 || sale anything that they have in their
00:14:44.389 || 00:14:44.399 || vaults and so
00:14:47.449 || 00:14:47.459 || the premiums have collapsed now the
00:14:49.670 || 00:14:49.680 || interesting thing about that done again
00:14:53.629 || 00:14:53.639 || is that I don't see that as being
00:14:56.090 || 00:14:56.100 || um anything rational in the respect that
00:14:58.310 || 00:14:58.320 || a little bit of a Slowdown in the
00:15:00.410 || 00:15:00.420 || premiums just come
00:15:03.470 || 00:15:03.480 || cratering down what happens if things
00:15:05.210 || 00:15:05.220 || get right back to where they were here
00:15:07.569 || 00:15:07.579 || the first second third week in January
00:15:10.430 || 00:15:10.440 || honestly I would have to say this is a
00:15:12.230 || 00:15:12.240 || sweet of a spot
00:15:14.569 || 00:15:14.579 || as I've seen since 2020 they're the
00:15:17.389 || 00:15:17.399 || lowest premiums I have seen since 2020
00:15:19.850 || 00:15:19.860 || and it happened out of the clear blue
00:15:21.949 || 00:15:21.959 || because a month ago getting product was
00:15:23.689 || 00:15:23.699 || next to Impossible and as we talked
00:15:26.810 || 00:15:26.820 || about on on your show last week a lot of
00:15:28.790 || 00:15:28.800 || the items that we are selling now we're
00:15:30.470 || 00:15:30.480 || selling at a loss and people you know
00:15:32.750 || 00:15:32.760 || have a hard time understanding that but
00:15:34.970 || 00:15:34.980 || it's you know when I'm buying product 8
00:15:37.069 || 00:15:37.079 || 10 12 weeks in advance
00:15:39.350 || 00:15:39.360 || and agreeing to pay a premium to these
00:15:41.210 || 00:15:41.220 || Distributors I'm not going to go back to
00:15:42.829 || 00:15:42.839 || them and say can we renegotiate that
00:15:44.870 || 00:15:44.880 || premium because they're now lower no it
00:15:46.850 || 00:15:46.860 || wasn't agreed upon deal price could have
00:15:48.410 || 00:15:48.420 || gone higher premiums could have gone
00:15:51.889 || 00:15:51.899 || higher so that's the way that it goes in
00:15:53.689 || 00:15:53.699 || this industry there's risk on both sides
00:15:56.150 || 00:15:56.160 || of the table your risks are risk our
00:15:58.009 || 00:15:58.019 || risk is is the same as yours in many
00:16:00.110 || 00:16:00.120 || respects only you know we're talking
00:16:02.629 || 00:16:02.639 || buying 20 30 40 million dollars worth
00:16:05.150 || 00:16:05.160 || and and selling it at a slight loss
00:16:06.889 || 00:16:06.899 || because premiums have come down you
00:16:08.569 || 00:16:08.579 || can't sell them at these high premiums
00:16:10.490 || 00:16:10.500 || or you won't be competitive now I could
00:16:12.650 || 00:16:12.660 || hold it and make the assumption that the
00:16:14.389 || 00:16:14.399 || premiums will rise and I'm assuming they
00:16:16.250 || 00:16:16.260 || will but that's not smart business
00:16:18.889 || 00:16:18.899 || either so any way you look at it this is
00:16:21.590 || 00:16:21.600 || a very unusual time where
00:16:24.189 || 00:16:24.199 || typically when you see great volatility
00:16:28.009 || 00:16:28.019 || whether it be in any Market it precedes
00:16:30.590 || 00:16:30.600 || some sort of a blow-off and I would
00:16:33.230 || 00:16:33.240 || simply say to you honestly that this is
00:16:34.970 || 00:16:34.980 || as good of a time as I've seen in three
00:16:38.110 || 00:16:38.120 || years to to add to a portfolio and
00:16:40.189 || 00:16:40.199 || nothing's changed if anything the
00:16:43.490 || 00:16:43.500 || world's gotten Crazier by the day
00:16:46.249 || 00:16:46.259 || the other part of the the retail price
00:16:48.110 || 00:16:48.120 || that people know how this goes together
00:16:50.090 || 00:16:50.100 || it's the spot price and then there's the
00:16:51.530 || 00:16:51.540 || premium on top of the spot price and
00:16:53.150 || 00:16:53.160 || that's your retail price when you're
00:16:56.030 || 00:16:56.040 || buying uh or when you're selling metals
00:16:58.310 || 00:16:58.320 || and it's funny if any of you haven't
00:17:02.930 || 00:17:02.940 || heard uh Rich Dad Poor Dad author uh
00:17:04.850 || 00:17:04.860 || when he when he gets in there and
00:17:07.549 || 00:17:07.559 || talking about his experience as a Marine
00:17:10.730 || 00:17:10.740 || in Vietnam uh it's quite quite
00:17:13.610 || 00:17:13.620 || Illuminating to hear him explain the
00:17:16.789 || 00:17:16.799 || going behind uh Enemy Lines on a chopper
00:17:18.590 || 00:17:18.600 || with his buddies to try to buy some gold
00:17:20.990 || 00:17:21.000 || he'd never bought gold before you go to
00:17:23.329 || 00:17:23.339 || this little village and he's he's
00:17:24.890 || 00:17:24.900 || finally gets to this old lady who's
00:17:27.350 || 00:17:27.360 || selling the gold this is Robert Kiyosaki
00:17:30.770 || 00:17:30.780 || and he says uh at the end he says um
00:17:33.289 || 00:17:33.299 || okay well can I get a discount and she
00:17:35.090 || 00:17:35.100 || looks up and she says what are you
00:17:37.549 || 00:17:37.559 || talking about spot is spot right and
00:17:39.770 || 00:17:39.780 || it's all over the world spotted spot so
00:17:42.409 || 00:17:42.419 || that's what I thought going into this
00:17:44.570 || 00:17:44.580 || and then as a as a broker I found out
00:17:47.450 || 00:17:47.460 || that clients were asking why do
00:17:49.669 || 00:17:49.679 || different dealers seem to sometimes have
00:17:52.370 || 00:17:52.380 || different spot prices and they're asking
00:17:54.409 || 00:17:54.419 || what's the basis of that I'm trying to
00:17:56.210 || 00:17:56.220 || find the question here I keep doing this
00:17:57.710 || 00:17:57.720 || wrong thing of scrolling off the page
00:17:59.330 || 00:17:59.340 || here because it keeps moving but the
00:18:01.610 || 00:18:01.620 || question was asked by by a by a
00:18:04.130 || 00:18:04.140 || questioner here how does miles Franklin
00:18:06.230 || 00:18:06.240 || come up with their spot price and how is
00:18:07.490 || 00:18:07.500 || it that different dealers will have
00:18:09.409 || 00:18:09.419 || different spot prices you'll typically
00:18:11.570 || 00:18:11.580 || see if you compare our spot price to the
00:18:14.870 || 00:18:14.880 || major retailers or less uh across the
00:18:16.130 || 00:18:16.140 || board
00:18:16.730 || 00:18:16.740 || um
00:18:19.430 || 00:18:19.440 || the reason and and you know maybe 10
00:18:21.529 || 00:18:21.539 || cents on Silver
00:18:24.049 || 00:18:24.059 || um maybe a dollar or two on gold could I
00:18:26.150 || 00:18:26.160 || say that they're padding their prices
00:18:30.049 || 00:18:30.059 || maybe uh maybe not because the way that
00:18:31.610 || 00:18:31.620 || it works it's kind of like a special
00:18:35.029 || 00:18:35.039 || sauce uh you have to take the most
00:18:37.549 || 00:18:37.559 || actively traded front month Futures
00:18:40.490 || 00:18:40.500 || Contract and then backtrack for time
00:18:43.130 || 00:18:43.140 || that's it's a switch it's basically
00:18:45.890 || 00:18:45.900 || called and what formula you use to
00:18:49.190 || 00:18:49.200 || backtrack to where we are in relation to
00:18:52.490 || 00:18:52.500 || the forward trading spot future month uh
00:18:54.230 || 00:18:54.240 || you you come up with the current spot
00:18:58.010 || 00:18:58.020 || price and you know by and large it
00:19:00.230 || 00:19:00.240 || shouldn't be more of a variance in five
00:19:03.409 || 00:19:03.419 || or ten cents on Silver and a dollar to
00:19:06.470 || 00:19:06.480 || Max on gold there is no exact way of
00:19:08.990 || 00:19:09.000 || doing it because it is the Futures price
00:19:11.570 || 00:19:11.580 || that you would see on comex and then you
00:19:13.610 || 00:19:13.620 || have to backtrack it when you try to
00:19:15.590 || 00:19:15.600 || figure out the exact spot price so
00:19:18.409 || 00:19:18.419 || there's a little bit of a of a formula
00:19:20.690 || 00:19:20.700 || involved in everyone's formula can be
00:19:22.730 || 00:19:22.740 || slightly different but when you compare
00:19:25.070 || 00:19:25.080 || the spot prices you'll find that we're
00:19:28.190 || 00:19:28.200 || typically going to be about five to ten
00:19:30.470 || 00:19:30.480 || cents Less on Silver than everybody I've
00:19:32.450 || 00:19:32.460 || noticed that myself the major retailers
00:19:36.230 || 00:19:36.240 || and a dollar or two Less on gold and um
00:19:38.270 || 00:19:38.280 || it's not a science but it should be very
00:19:40.549 || 00:19:40.559 || very very close nonetheless
00:19:43.610 || 00:19:43.620 || one more tip that is not obvious at all
00:19:45.590 || 00:19:45.600 || it wasn't to me for years is that
00:19:47.870 || 00:19:47.880 || there's a difference as always when it's
00:19:50.090 || 00:19:50.100 || a live market between bid and ask I mean
00:19:52.250 || 00:19:52.260 || that's true for any stocks if you go to
00:19:54.950 || 00:19:54.960 || look at any uh stocks you can see the
00:19:57.289 || 00:19:57.299 || bid which is all the willing all the
00:19:59.990 || 00:20:00.000 || Willing uh buyers are saying you know
00:20:01.610 || 00:20:01.620 || I'm willing to pay this much and then
00:20:03.110 || 00:20:03.120 || there's the ask which is willing sellers
00:20:04.430 || 00:20:04.440 || when usually there's a gap between the
00:20:06.230 || 00:20:06.240 || two and until someone's willing to come
00:20:08.690 || 00:20:08.700 || across and say okay I'll pay your ask or
00:20:10.430 || 00:20:10.440 || okay I'll sell you for the bid or meet
00:20:12.230 || 00:20:12.240 || in the middle somewhere which might be a
00:20:13.669 || 00:20:13.679 || last trade that's neither at the bid or
00:20:16.909 || 00:20:16.919 || the ask you don't get any trades because
00:20:18.230 || 00:20:18.240 || there's a difference there and there has
00:20:19.610 || 00:20:19.620 || to be people willing to come across in
00:20:21.350 || 00:20:21.360 || order if there to be trades one of the
00:20:22.970 || 00:20:22.980 || things that's not obvious is a lot of
00:20:26.270 || 00:20:26.280 || the the data feeds you might find for
00:20:28.970 || 00:20:28.980 || live charts of spot price for gold and
00:20:31.130 || 00:20:31.140 || silver may be fed from someplace like
00:20:33.590 || 00:20:33.600 || Kitco or others and those by default are
00:20:36.049 || 00:20:36.059 || showing you the bid the bid is the lower
00:20:37.909 || 00:20:37.919 || of the prices which is of no use to
00:20:38.990 || 00:20:39.000 || people who are trying I don't know why
00:20:41.990 || 00:20:42.000 || it makes zero sense if 90 of the people
00:20:43.430 || 00:20:43.440 || right now are trying to buy metals they
00:20:45.650 || 00:20:45.660 || care about the ask not the bid it makes
00:20:47.570 || 00:20:47.580 || zero sense that they do that I don't
00:20:50.390 || 00:20:50.400 || understand it and um you know then
00:20:53.409 || 00:20:53.419 || they'll say well I show it's you know
00:20:57.650 || 00:20:57.660 || 23.87 no no it's it's not it's 24 what
00:20:59.090 || 00:20:59.100 || do you mean I know you're looking at the
00:21:00.710 || 00:21:00.720 || bid price and then you have to it makes
00:21:04.190 || 00:21:04.200 || no sense that the feed that KidCo pushes
00:21:07.130 || 00:21:07.140 || is the bid price and that is true and
00:21:09.529 || 00:21:09.539 || also you can talk about placing an order
00:21:11.029 || 00:21:11.039 || over the weekend you know the market
00:21:14.270 || 00:21:14.280 || sleeps from Friday at five o'clock or
00:21:16.070 || 00:21:16.080 || six o'clock Eastern until roughly the
00:21:18.950 || 00:21:18.960 || same time on Sunday six o'clock Eastern
00:21:20.990 || 00:21:21.000 || and it sleeps and so that's the only
00:21:23.210 || 00:21:23.220 || time when it's not alive and then it
00:21:26.029 || 00:21:26.039 || opens back up in Asia around 6 p.m
00:21:28.909 || 00:21:28.919 || Eastern on Sunday so if I'm doing a
00:21:31.310 || 00:21:31.320 || trade in that window you'll find
00:21:33.590 || 00:21:33.600 || typically that the dealers will add
00:21:35.690 || 00:21:35.700 || another 10 cents to silver or another
00:21:37.610 || 00:21:37.620 || few dollars to go because they're taking
00:21:40.310 || 00:21:40.320 || the risk that the market pops open like
00:21:43.130 || 00:21:43.140 || that that this was a phenomena we saw
00:21:46.970 || 00:21:46.980 || over silver squeeze in 2021 where we had
00:21:48.529 || 00:21:48.539 || heard that something was going to happen
00:21:51.409 || 00:21:51.419 || and and we bought like uh I don't know
00:21:54.649 || 00:21:54.659 || seven uh seven Futures contracts in
00:21:56.810 || 00:21:56.820 || silver over the weekend which would have
00:21:58.370 || 00:21:58.380 || put us long 35
00:22:00.409 || 00:22:00.419 || 000 ounces before Saturday morning even
00:22:02.870 || 00:22:02.880 || rolled along we had sold like 60 000
00:22:05.630 || 00:22:05.640 || ounces and we were naked exposed at that
00:22:08.690 || 00:22:08.700 || point then 25 000 ounces to the open and
00:22:10.610 || 00:22:10.620 || when the market opened by the grace of
00:22:12.590 || 00:22:12.600 || God it didn't open up 10 or 20 dollars
00:22:14.149 || 00:22:14.159 || like people thought it capped up a
00:22:16.490 || 00:22:16.500 || dollar and a half cost us 40 Grand like
00:22:19.850 || 00:22:19.860 || that and so there's a lot involved in
00:22:22.250 || 00:22:22.260 || hedging and using spot and locking
00:22:23.950 || 00:22:23.960 || things in it's not as
00:22:26.930 || 00:22:26.940 || straightforward as people think and
00:22:29.630 || 00:22:29.640 || um there's risk involved in anything in
00:22:32.870 || 00:22:32.880 || life and whether it be us securing the
00:22:35.270 || 00:22:35.280 || product hedging it or selling it over a
00:22:37.909 || 00:22:37.919 || weekend or you know any of the the
00:22:40.490 || 00:22:40.500 || Myriad of things buying coins that have
00:22:42.590 || 00:22:42.600 || a high premium and then before you even
00:22:45.289 || 00:22:45.299 || receive them across the Atlantic Ocean
00:22:48.230 || 00:22:48.240 || the premiums have have come down this is
00:22:51.590 || 00:22:51.600 || just par for the course but look you
00:22:53.450 || 00:22:53.460 || ain't seen anything yet that's all I got
00:22:56.090 || 00:22:56.100 || to say it doesn't bother me because I
00:22:58.250 || 00:22:58.260 || know that we haven't seen a damn thing
00:22:59.810 || 00:22:59.820 || yet and
00:23:03.289 || 00:23:03.299 || when rates accentuate themselves uh and
00:23:05.390 || 00:23:05.400 || get high enough
00:23:08.090 || 00:23:08.100 || to really start to Rattle the markets
00:23:10.250 || 00:23:10.260 || and or the fed and their policy
00:23:12.590 || 00:23:12.600 || decisions you will see people in the
00:23:14.270 || 00:23:14.280 || mainstream wake up to an alternative
00:23:17.390 || 00:23:17.400 || because you know everyone who's wealthy
00:23:19.610 || 00:23:19.620 || in this country by and large has an
00:23:21.470 || 00:23:21.480 || allocation of stocks and bonds in real
00:23:24.470 || 00:23:24.480 || estate and it's it's worked well until
00:23:27.529 || 00:23:27.539 || it doesn't and they haven't thought of
00:23:29.210 || 00:23:29.220 || Alternatives they've had no reason to
00:23:31.909 || 00:23:31.919 || until they do and that's when everything
00:23:33.950 || 00:23:33.960 || that I've seen and talked about happens
00:23:35.990 || 00:23:36.000 || I have a curse of seeing things too far
00:23:37.730 || 00:23:37.740 || ahead I mean it's just logic all you
00:23:39.950 || 00:23:39.960 || gotta do is put logic to this and when
00:23:41.330 || 00:23:41.340 || you look at what the rest of the world
00:23:44.350 || 00:23:44.360 || is doing right now de-dollarizing
00:23:47.090 || 00:23:47.100 || it's just an inevitability the question
00:23:52.010 || 00:23:52.020 || is when and these pullbacks in premium
00:23:53.390 || 00:23:53.400 || and price
00:23:54.890 || 00:23:54.900 || and rhetoric
00:23:57.409 || 00:23:57.419 || these are all opportunities if you see
00:23:59.510 || 00:23:59.520 || the big picture at least that's the way
00:24:01.430 || 00:24:01.440 || I look at the big picture
00:24:03.890 || 00:24:03.900 || we also have had a lot of concern about
00:24:05.990 || 00:24:06.000 || clients uh concerned about government
00:24:08.570 || 00:24:08.580 || reporting government scrutiny Bank
00:24:11.149 || 00:24:11.159 || scrutiny I can't tell you how many
00:24:13.310 || 00:24:13.320 || questions every week from clients saying
00:24:15.110 || 00:24:15.120 || gee what if I go over the ten thousand
00:24:16.669 || 00:24:16.679 || dollar limit will that be will my
00:24:18.169 || 00:24:18.179 || purchase be reported or if I buy more
00:24:19.250 || 00:24:19.260 || than a certain amount with my purchase
00:24:20.750 || 00:24:20.760 || be reported if I live in California and
00:24:22.190 || 00:24:22.200 || I buy more than a certain my purchase
00:24:23.810 || 00:24:23.820 || would be reported and we have to keep
00:24:25.730 || 00:24:25.740 || reminding people that Miles Franklin
00:24:27.590 || 00:24:27.600 || never and dealers do not are not
00:24:30.409 || 00:24:30.419 || mandated to report sales so we can sell
00:24:33.110 || 00:24:33.120 || any amount of medals to anybody in any
00:24:35.570 || 00:24:35.580 || state and there's no mandated reporting
00:24:37.970 || 00:24:37.980 || there is some confusion then about we've
00:24:40.190 || 00:24:40.200 || talked about this before 1099b reporting
00:24:42.049 || 00:24:42.059 || when we buy back from clients certain
00:24:44.090 || 00:24:44.100 || quantities of certain products but
00:24:46.070 || 00:24:46.080 || there's also concern new concerns coming
00:24:47.510 || 00:24:47.520 || out about well why are the banks asking
00:24:48.830 || 00:24:48.840 || more questions than they used to ask and
00:24:50.029 || 00:24:50.039 || there was a new one that came up this
00:24:51.830 || 00:24:51.840 || this week it was new to me and I was
00:24:53.470 || 00:24:53.480 || saying somebody's saying that in the new
00:24:57.289 || 00:24:57.299 || 2023 1040 Forum there's a question about
00:24:59.390 || 00:24:59.400 || do you own any gold or silver and is
00:25:01.370 || 00:25:01.380 || this new intrusion a new snooping by the
00:25:03.529 || 00:25:03.539 || government I looked it up I could not
00:25:04.970 || 00:25:04.980 || find any references to that so if
00:25:06.710 || 00:25:06.720 || anybody has a reference to that or a
00:25:08.450 || 00:25:08.460 || link to an actual IRS document please
00:25:10.850 || 00:25:10.860 || email it to me at Liberty and finance at
00:25:14.149 || 00:25:14.159 || protonmail.com what I did find was a lot
00:25:16.970 || 00:25:16.980 || of Articles from various
00:25:19.610 || 00:25:19.620 || Financial advice sites telling you about
00:25:22.490 || 00:25:22.500 || capital gains taxes and how you can if
00:25:24.169 || 00:25:24.179 || you don't want to pay the 28
00:25:26.690 || 00:25:26.700 || Collectibles capital gains tax on owning
00:25:28.430 || 00:25:28.440 || physical precious metals then just buy
00:25:31.130 || 00:25:31.140 || an ETF that that doesn't allow you to
00:25:32.510 || 00:25:32.520 || take for physical possession and then
00:25:33.590 || 00:25:33.600 || you can treat it like a stock and hold
00:25:34.789 || 00:25:34.799 || it for more than 12 months and all this
00:25:36.110 || 00:25:36.120 || stuff and it'll solve all your problems
00:25:38.230 || 00:25:38.240 || so can you address that question about
00:25:41.149 || 00:25:41.159 || new intrusive questions whether you've
00:25:42.350 || 00:25:42.360 || heard about any from either the
00:25:45.049 || 00:25:45.059 || government from Banks the IRS about
00:25:47.029 || 00:25:47.039 || reporting that's number one and number
00:25:47.930 || 00:25:47.940 || two
00:25:50.149 || 00:25:50.159 || uh if people really do want to own
00:25:51.769 || 00:25:51.779 || physical precious metals is there any
00:25:53.570 || 00:25:53.580 || tax smart way to do it knowing that
00:25:55.490 || 00:25:55.500 || we're not tax advisors
00:25:57.890 || 00:25:57.900 || well the I you know the banks have been
00:25:59.390 || 00:25:59.400 || getting worse and worse and worse and on
00:26:01.130 || 00:26:01.140 || a big picture you know look at it from
00:26:02.630 || 00:26:02.640 || the bank's perspective and I don't know
00:26:04.250 || 00:26:04.260 || if you wanted to even take it further
00:26:06.769 || 00:26:06.779 || and say that the government is all over
00:26:08.570 || 00:26:08.580 || and telling them that they need to do
00:26:11.029 || 00:26:11.039 || this maybe maybe that's part of it but
00:26:13.610 || 00:26:13.620 || you know the banks right now in this
00:26:16.850 || 00:26:16.860 || look We've Ended a 40-year trip we are
00:26:19.310 || 00:26:19.320 || ending a 40-year trend of declining
00:26:20.990 || 00:26:21.000 || interest rates and that's being replaced
00:26:24.350 || 00:26:24.360 || with Rising interest rates and and the
00:26:26.029 || 00:26:26.039 || banks are starting to rein in credit
00:26:27.830 || 00:26:27.840 || you're seeing over two trillion dollars
00:26:29.750 || 00:26:29.760 || in the reverse repo Market the banks
00:26:31.310 || 00:26:31.320 || don't want to lend money out into the
00:26:33.409 || 00:26:33.419 || system they'd rather leave it at the FED
00:26:35.690 || 00:26:35.700 || earning next you know four percent with
00:26:38.450 || 00:26:38.460 || safety rather than lend it out to you or
00:26:41.510 || 00:26:41.520 || I for a car payment or or a home equity
00:26:43.610 || 00:26:43.620 || loan or whatever it may be and we're
00:26:45.529 || 00:26:45.539 || seeing a sea change with Bankers where
00:26:48.529 || 00:26:48.539 || in Mass psychology we're Greed for
00:26:50.750 || 00:26:50.760 || profits and Landing is being replaced
00:26:52.730 || 00:26:52.740 || with caution and fear so that's the way
00:26:53.810 || 00:26:53.820 || that they're looking they're they're
00:26:55.190 || 00:26:55.200 || concerned but they're also concerned
00:26:58.250 || 00:26:58.260 || about losing depositors and when I did
00:27:01.250 || 00:27:01.260 || that very large deal in July it took a
00:27:03.289 || 00:27:03.299 || woman four days to get 50 million
00:27:04.730 || 00:27:04.740 || dollars taken out of her bank account
00:27:06.289 || 00:27:06.299 || that's what she wanted me to tell
00:27:08.210 || 00:27:08.220 || everyone that look it's a lot easier to
00:27:10.070 || 00:27:10.080 || deposit 50 million than it is to get it
00:27:12.830 || 00:27:12.840 || out and I'm a big client and and so the
00:27:14.510 || 00:27:14.520 || banks are concerned about losing money
00:27:16.250 || 00:27:16.260 || and they want to know what where are you
00:27:17.930 || 00:27:17.940 || putting your money well none of your
00:27:20.090 || 00:27:20.100 || damn business but I think more than
00:27:22.430 || 00:27:22.440 || anything they're just very concerned
00:27:24.289 || 00:27:24.299 || about
00:27:25.970 || 00:27:25.980 || um you know people pulling their money
00:27:27.710 || 00:27:27.720 || out of a banking system that's over
00:27:29.630 || 00:27:29.640 || leverage leverage that's paying nothing
00:27:31.370 || 00:27:31.380 || you know even though rates are rising we
00:27:33.529 || 00:27:33.539 || haven't seen any any of that move over
00:27:35.269 || 00:27:35.279 || into checking and savings accounts
00:27:37.010 || 00:27:37.020 || they're still next to nothing so people
00:27:39.769 || 00:27:39.779 || look at the risk associated the systemic
00:27:42.590 || 00:27:42.600 || risk they look at something like FTX
00:27:45.230 || 00:27:45.240 || they look at these you know these these
00:27:47.090 || 00:27:47.100 || dominoes that could fall and they say oh
00:27:48.649 || 00:27:48.659 || I'm leaving my money in a bank where
00:27:50.870 || 00:27:50.880 || FDIC insurance is woefully under
00:27:53.930 || 00:27:53.940 || capitalized and you know and and I'm
00:27:55.310 || 00:27:55.320 || getting nothing in return so I'm going
00:27:56.930 || 00:27:56.940 || to pull my money out well the banks
00:27:58.610 || 00:27:58.620 || don't like that so much and they're
00:28:00.890 || 00:28:00.900 || inquisitive have I heard of anything
00:28:04.909 || 00:28:04.919 || that is new no I mean I went I told the
00:28:06.769 || 00:28:06.779 || story of I had two two thousand dollar
00:28:09.409 || 00:28:09.419 || checks and and I went to the bank and I
00:28:11.330 || 00:28:11.340 || wanted all twenty dollar bills and and
00:28:12.950 || 00:28:12.960 || the lady said well that'll be a very big
00:28:14.690 || 00:28:14.700 || step you know I said yeah that's okay
00:28:17.510 || 00:28:17.520 || I'm okay with it and uh she said what
00:28:18.890 || 00:28:18.900 || are you gonna do with it and I took
00:28:21.230 || 00:28:21.240 || everything I had to not really go off
00:28:23.570 || 00:28:23.580 || and just I wanted it so badly
00:28:25.610 || 00:28:25.620 || but I didn't I said I got a plan for it
00:28:27.529 || 00:28:27.539 || and she you could see she spent four
00:28:29.390 || 00:28:29.400 || minutes typing something out basically
00:28:31.310 || 00:28:31.320 || saying I'm a drug dealer or whatever it
00:28:33.230 || 00:28:33.240 || was and she was putting in her
00:28:35.570 || 00:28:35.580 || suspicious activity report from the SARS
00:28:36.769 || 00:28:36.779 || form
00:28:38.870 || 00:28:38.880 || this is the world we live in I guess
00:28:41.330 || 00:28:41.340 || right now and you know it's it's
00:28:43.789 || 00:28:43.799 || decreasing privacy it's a world where
00:28:46.370 || 00:28:46.380 || privacy is something that is fleeting
00:28:48.169 || 00:28:48.179 || and one of the things that I enjoy the
00:28:50.930 || 00:28:50.940 || most about my medals is that no one
00:28:52.610 || 00:28:52.620 || knows what I have I don't even really
00:28:55.850 || 00:28:55.860 || know exactly what I have and I I think
00:28:58.250 || 00:28:58.260 || that you know you could call it a
00:29:00.950 || 00:29:00.960 || loophole now as far as a legal loophole
00:29:03.649 || 00:29:03.659 || where there's still a way to legally
00:29:05.570 || 00:29:05.580 || have some privacy because when you buy
00:29:08.390 || 00:29:08.400 || it the only loss in privacy in buying
00:29:10.130 || 00:29:10.140 || metal is writing on a check or sending a
00:29:12.110 || 00:29:12.120 || wire is that a loss in privacy maybe
00:29:14.870 || 00:29:14.880 || maybe not I don't know it disappears and
00:29:16.549 || 00:29:16.559 || then and then the metal is buried
00:29:18.889 || 00:29:18.899 || somewhere in your backyard you've got to
00:29:20.990 || 00:29:21.000 || try to find I don't remember where I put
00:29:22.610 || 00:29:22.620 || it I'll figure it out it's there
00:29:25.130 || 00:29:25.140 || somewhere but the point of it is is that
00:29:29.210 || 00:29:29.220 || no it's one of the last few things that
00:29:30.649 || 00:29:30.659 || give you privacy in a world of
00:29:33.049 || 00:29:33.059 || diminished privacy increased litigation
00:29:34.210 || 00:29:34.220 || and
00:29:37.909 || 00:29:37.919 || uh at this point no we have no
00:29:39.889 || 00:29:39.899 || obligation to report anything unless
00:29:42.769 || 00:29:42.779 || someone pays us with more than ten
00:29:44.750 || 00:29:44.760 || thousand dollars in multiple money
00:29:47.029 || 00:29:47.039 || orders or in green money twenty dollar
00:29:48.769 || 00:29:48.779 || bills hundred dollar bills short of that
00:29:50.630 || 00:29:50.640 || you could spend a hundred million
00:29:51.769 || 00:29:51.779 || dollars
00:29:54.529 || 00:29:54.539 || or 50 million dollars in the case of
00:29:56.510 || 00:29:56.520 || someone we worked with and there's no
00:29:59.149 || 00:29:59.159 || reporting whatsoever and
00:29:59.990 || 00:30:00.000 || um
00:30:01.850 || 00:30:01.860 || it's one of the few things left in this
00:30:03.549 || 00:30:03.559 || world where you can say that
00:30:05.930 || 00:30:05.940 || we've got uh questions from people
00:30:09.470 || 00:30:09.480 || talking about the relative we thought we
00:30:11.090 || 00:30:11.100 || were done we're not about premiums
00:30:13.190 || 00:30:13.200 || relative premiums between for example
00:30:16.190 || 00:30:16.200 || Platinum versus Silver versus gold but
00:30:18.649 || 00:30:18.659 || also between High premium and low
00:30:20.870 || 00:30:20.880 || premium coins so if you look at silver
00:30:23.269 || 00:30:23.279 || coins right now the premiums on American
00:30:25.430 || 00:30:25.440 || Eagles are higher than the premiums on
00:30:27.529 || 00:30:27.539 || Silver Maples that's that's normal but
00:30:29.510 || 00:30:29.520 || it's it's been more than usual in the
00:30:32.330 || 00:30:32.340 || last year or two uh the question is if
00:30:34.789 || 00:30:34.799 || if silver spot price goes way up do we
00:30:37.070 || 00:30:37.080 || expect that the premium difference to
00:30:39.470 || 00:30:39.480 || scale uh Chris one two three four says
00:30:41.750 || 00:30:41.760 || if Silver Spot were a hundred will an
00:30:44.049 || 00:30:44.059 || eagle still be worth more than a maple
00:30:47.090 || 00:30:47.100 || you know the the way I used to look at
00:30:49.789 || 00:30:49.799 || it would be no it would announce is
00:30:51.649 || 00:30:51.659 || announce at that point
00:30:53.750 || 00:30:53.760 || you know all I can tell you is that for
00:30:55.850 || 00:30:55.860 || the last three years the premium on
00:30:57.830 || 00:30:57.840 || Silver Eagles has been detached from
00:30:59.450 || 00:30:59.460 || everything else it has been as much as
00:31:01.909 || 00:31:01.919 || two to three times of everything else
00:31:05.510 || 00:31:05.520 || and there are people out there who
00:31:08.149 || 00:31:08.159 || who truly believe that
00:31:09.889 || 00:31:09.899 || now I'm not saying this is what I
00:31:11.750 || 00:31:11.760 || believe I'm just saying that there are
00:31:13.690 || 00:31:13.700 || people that believe this
00:31:17.990 || 00:31:18.000 || that if the government were to intervene
00:31:21.230 || 00:31:21.240 || that american-issued coins and bars
00:31:23.690 || 00:31:23.700 || would would be sheltered from a future
00:31:26.029 || 00:31:26.039 || confiscation and it would be other items
00:31:27.590 || 00:31:27.600 || that would be confiscated now I've
00:31:29.630 || 00:31:29.640 || talked about this this was something
00:31:31.610 || 00:31:31.620 || that Jim Sinclair talked about publicly
00:31:34.370 || 00:31:34.380 || I don't have a problem in saying it uh I
00:31:35.930 || 00:31:35.940 || went to dinner with Jim one night and he
00:31:37.730 || 00:31:37.740 || told me this that he had heard from
00:31:40.909 || 00:31:40.919 || someone that he trusted that was you
00:31:43.549 || 00:31:43.559 || know very very connected that that
00:31:45.830 || 00:31:45.840 || there'd be two resets that the first You
00:31:47.389 || 00:31:47.399 || could argue were in the midst of would
00:31:49.310 || 00:31:49.320 || be man-made the second would be one by
00:31:51.350 || 00:31:51.360 || Mother Nature and when that happened
00:31:53.630 || 00:31:53.640 || metals that weren't American in origin
00:31:55.490 || 00:31:55.500 || would be confiscated now I own a lot of
00:31:57.350 || 00:31:57.360 || medals that are not American in origin
00:32:00.169 || 00:32:00.179 || although I know he believes this I had
00:32:02.750 || 00:32:02.760 || not been motivated to this point to do
00:32:05.810 || 00:32:05.820 || that to trade my Canadian Mint 100 ounce
00:32:07.970 || 00:32:07.980 || bars or my Royal Canadian Mint gold
00:32:10.250 || 00:32:10.260 || coins for American Eagles
00:32:13.549 || 00:32:13.559 || I could but I haven't because of the big
00:32:16.669 || 00:32:16.679 || premium discrepancy so there are people
00:32:18.409 || 00:32:18.419 || who believe that maybe that's part of it
00:32:20.630 || 00:32:20.640 || I don't know what I do know is that the
00:32:22.669 || 00:32:22.679 || U.S mint made about a third as many
00:32:25.909 || 00:32:25.919 || silver eagles as they have the ability
00:32:27.710 || 00:32:27.720 || to do they made somewhere in the
00:32:29.930 || 00:32:29.940 || neighborhood of 14 15 million I've seen
00:32:33.049 || 00:32:33.059 || them make 40 and 50 million myself so
00:32:35.389 || 00:32:35.399 || what does that mean Janet Yellen said
00:32:37.250 || 00:32:37.260 || they ramped up silver production sure
00:32:40.310 || 00:32:40.320 || didn't look that way to me
00:32:42.830 || 00:32:42.840 || um is there something nefarious behind
00:32:44.510 || 00:32:44.520 || it there are people who think that there
00:32:46.010 || 00:32:46.020 || is there are people who think that
00:32:48.110 || 00:32:48.120 || they'll issue a gold and silver back
00:32:50.450 || 00:32:50.460 || system and and these coins are being
00:32:53.210 || 00:32:53.220 || minted imported by the US government I
00:32:54.769 || 00:32:54.779 || don't know what to believe anymore when
00:32:56.330 || 00:32:56.340 || we talk about the U.S mint because
00:32:59.510 || 00:32:59.520 || because they really have been look
00:33:02.389 || 00:33:02.399 || they've made a big their big part of my
00:33:04.250 || 00:33:04.260 || career being a U.S mint authorized
00:33:06.590 || 00:33:06.600 || representative a reseller is something
00:33:08.450 || 00:33:08.460 || that has defined my career in many
00:33:09.889 || 00:33:09.899 || respects but they've been very
00:33:11.990 || 00:33:12.000 || disciplined pointing in the way that
00:33:14.149 || 00:33:14.159 || they have provided gold and silver to
00:33:17.570 || 00:33:17.580 || the U.S public and here we are today
00:33:19.310 || 00:33:19.320 || where the premiums on everything have
00:33:21.350 || 00:33:21.360 || come down and we're still double digit
00:33:24.350 || 00:33:24.360 || on Silver Eagles or real darn close to
00:33:25.669 || 00:33:25.679 || it I haven't looked yet this afternoon
00:33:29.930 || 00:33:29.940 || this evening but here again you know
00:33:32.090 || 00:33:32.100 || um there are just some people who want
00:33:35.630 || 00:33:35.640 || American-made coins and bars and I don't
00:33:38.330 || 00:33:38.340 || know what premium will do when the price
00:33:40.669 || 00:33:40.679 || gets that high I would simply say this
00:33:43.250 || 00:33:43.260 || when the price gets that high maybe
00:33:46.190 || 00:33:46.200 || everyone in this country will wake up
00:33:49.090 || 00:33:49.100 || and we'll do whatever they can to buy
00:33:51.769 || 00:33:51.779 || precious metals because look
00:33:54.649 || 00:33:54.659 || there are no inversely correlated assets
00:33:56.690 || 00:33:56.700 || anymore to the U.S stock market or the
00:34:00.230 || 00:34:00.240 || dollar besides precious metals and if we
00:34:02.450 || 00:34:02.460 || see problems in the markets which I
00:34:04.490 || 00:34:04.500 || believe we will the only inversely
00:34:06.350 || 00:34:06.360 || correlated asset according to ibidson
00:34:07.909 || 00:34:07.919 || and you have this you can send it to
00:34:10.790 || 00:34:10.800 || people the article on if it's in is gold
00:34:13.190 || 00:34:13.200 || and silver it's precious metals it is a
00:34:16.490 || 00:34:16.500 || hedge against the lunacy of our federal
00:34:18.589 || 00:34:18.599 || reserve of our government and the
00:34:21.589 || 00:34:21.599 || distortions that were created by the
00:34:23.810 || 00:34:23.820 || irresponsible monetary policies that
00:34:25.550 || 00:34:25.560 || we've seen over the last three years and
00:34:28.129 || 00:34:28.139 || so you buy gold and silver whatever you
00:34:29.930 || 00:34:29.940 || can and this is why I pull people don't
00:34:31.609 || 00:34:31.619 || pay the extra premium for the eagles
00:34:33.710 || 00:34:33.720 || look if I had my brothers that's all I'd
00:34:34.550 || 00:34:34.560 || buy
00:34:37.010 || 00:34:37.020 || but when it comes at the expense of so
00:34:40.310 || 00:34:40.320 || much in the way of ounces it's a mistake
00:34:42.649 || 00:34:42.659 || um if money isn't an issue yeah buy
00:34:45.710 || 00:34:45.720 || Eagles buy 20 gold pieces buy Morgan
00:34:49.070 || 00:34:49.080 || silver dollars I mean I would if money
00:34:51.649 || 00:34:51.659 || wasn't at issue but if you're looking to
00:34:54.349 || 00:34:54.359 || get a position into silver and gold and
00:34:56.030 || 00:34:56.040 || get the biggest bang for the buck you
00:34:58.490 || 00:34:58.500 || won't find it right now and for the last
00:35:00.410 || 00:35:00.420 || three years in anything with an American
00:35:02.510 || 00:35:02.520 || stamp on it
00:35:04.849 || 00:35:04.859 || this question has come up before but and
00:35:06.290 || 00:35:06.300 || we just hinted at it a minute ago but
00:35:07.910 || 00:35:07.920 || I'm going to ask it again and before I
00:35:09.530 || 00:35:09.540 || when you're when you're done I'm going
00:35:11.510 || 00:35:11.520 || to tell people that they can email us
00:35:13.190 || 00:35:13.200 || for a link to the to a document around
00:35:15.650 || 00:35:15.660 || this but slick Willie asks how much can
00:35:17.569 || 00:35:17.579 || someone sell before miles Franklin
00:35:20.270 || 00:35:20.280 || reports it to the IRS
00:35:22.609 || 00:35:22.619 || you can sell anything you want we won't
00:35:24.290 || 00:35:24.300 || report it there are only a few things
00:35:26.690 || 00:35:26.700 || that trigger dealer reporting so if
00:35:29.510 || 00:35:29.520 || you're selling gold in coins there are
00:35:30.890 || 00:35:30.900 || three coins that trigger dealer
00:35:34.750 || 00:35:34.760 || reporting on the 25th ounce in one sale
00:35:37.130 || 00:35:37.140 || krugerrands Maple Leaves Mexican 50
00:35:41.210 || 00:35:41.220 || pesos that's it you sell me 24 ounces I
00:35:42.950 || 00:35:42.960 || don't have to report it I don't want you
00:35:44.690 || 00:35:44.700 || to tell me you have a hundred ounces and
00:35:46.370 || 00:35:46.380 || you plan on selling four separate
00:35:48.530 || 00:35:48.540 || tranches to avoid reporting you just
00:35:50.030 || 00:35:50.040 || call me and tell me you need to sell 24
00:35:51.530 || 00:35:51.540 || ounces today and you can call me
00:35:53.510 || 00:35:53.520 || tomorrow and say the same thing and it's
00:35:55.130 || 00:35:55.140 || four days later and say the same thing
00:35:57.170 || 00:35:57.180 || the day after that the same thing in
00:36:00.650 || 00:36:00.660 || gold bars it's a kilo anything a kilo or
00:36:04.490 || 00:36:04.500 || bigger 32.15 ounces so sell me 32 bars
00:36:06.530 || 00:36:06.540 || at a time I don't need your social
00:36:08.810 || 00:36:08.820 || security number I won't report it
00:36:11.930 || 00:36:11.940 || uh and that is in one transaction you
00:36:13.790 || 00:36:13.800 || can't send me a hundred bars and have me
00:36:17.329 || 00:36:17.339 || sell 32 at a time but I can sell 32 one
00:36:19.069 || 00:36:19.079 || ounce gold bars as often as you'd like
00:36:21.230 || 00:36:21.240 || and 24 krugerrands as often as you'd
00:36:25.490 || 00:36:25.500 || like that's it in silver it's so the
00:36:27.829 || 00:36:27.839 || American Eagle or the maple leaf any of
00:36:29.690 || 00:36:29.700 || the Sovereign coins will not trigger
00:36:32.329 || 00:36:32.339 || dealer reporting on sale back ever the
00:36:33.890 || 00:36:33.900 || only things that will trigger dealer
00:36:36.829 || 00:36:36.839 || reporting in silver would be pre-65
00:36:39.890 || 00:36:39.900 || silver chunk silver in quantities in
00:36:42.109 || 00:36:42.119 || excess of a thousand dollars face value
00:36:44.329 || 00:36:44.339 || ten thousand dimes four thousand
00:36:46.670 || 00:36:46.680 || quarters two thousand halves any
00:36:49.190 || 00:36:49.200 || combination that equals a thousand faced
00:36:52.190 || 00:36:52.200 || which is 715 ounces you sell anything
00:36:54.230 || 00:36:54.240 || under that amount in one transaction
00:36:56.270 || 00:36:56.280 || don't eat it don't tell me how much you
00:36:57.950 || 00:36:57.960 || got but tell me you need to sell more
00:37:00.349 || 00:37:00.359 || and then under three quarters of a bag
00:37:02.210 || 00:37:02.220 || today half a bag tomorrow three quarters
00:37:04.010 || 00:37:04.020 || the next day 900 face the next day
00:37:06.670 || 00:37:06.680 || that's all legal these are legal
00:37:10.130 || 00:37:10.140 || ways of exploiting the law to your
00:37:11.410 || 00:37:11.420 || benefit
00:37:13.790 || 00:37:13.800 || walking all the way to the edge of
00:37:15.710 || 00:37:15.720 || Legally looking over it not stepping
00:37:17.990 || 00:37:18.000 || over it also in silver would be bars or
00:37:20.329 || 00:37:20.339 || rounds so generic rounds the Buffalo
00:37:23.089 || 00:37:23.099 || round uh any of the silver rounds that
00:37:25.609 || 00:37:25.619 || don't have a legal tender face on it so
00:37:27.230 || 00:37:27.240 || you know the Kruger and the maple the
00:37:29.210 || 00:37:29.220 || kangaroo the Philharmonic the Britannia
00:37:30.710 || 00:37:30.720 || the eagle those are all exempt from
00:37:33.829 || 00:37:33.839 || dealer reporting but a round or a bar in
00:37:36.890 || 00:37:36.900 || excess of a thousand ounces need your
00:37:40.430 || 00:37:40.440 || social anything under I don't so that's
00:37:43.550 || 00:37:43.560 || it nothing else will trigger dealer
00:37:46.430 || 00:37:46.440 || reporting and our job is to tell you
00:37:49.730 || 00:37:49.740 || what the law is not how to evade it we
00:37:52.490 || 00:37:52.500 || can show you how to legally avoid paying
00:37:54.890 || 00:37:54.900 || taxes we won't show you how to evade
00:37:57.230 || 00:37:57.240 || paying taxes but to legally avoid them
00:37:59.569 || 00:37:59.579 || and do it the right way all we have to
00:38:01.310 || 00:38:01.320 || do is tell you what the law is and leave
00:38:04.010 || 00:38:04.020 || it up to you from that point but um look
00:38:06.109 || 00:38:06.119 || if you exceed a thousand ounces in bar
00:38:08.030 || 00:38:08.040 || around form if you exceed a thousand

00:39:00.650 || 00:39:00.660 || Andy mentioned both by my metal because
00:39:02.270 || 00:39:02.280 || it's different for a silver versus Gold
00:39:04.910 || 00:39:04.920 || by product type and by weight in a
00:39:06.410 || 00:39:06.420 || single transaction and you should be
00:39:08.150 || 00:39:08.160 || well set
00:39:09.410 || 00:39:09.420 || let's see if we have any more questions
00:39:10.550 || 00:39:10.560 || here before we gotta wrap up because
00:39:12.410 || 00:39:12.420 || we're getting short on time here
00:39:17.810 || 00:39:17.820 || uh what are the questions people have
00:39:19.970 || 00:39:19.980 || you mentioned privacy and we've talked
00:39:20.870 || 00:39:20.880 || about it from a couple different
00:39:23.810 || 00:39:23.820 || different directions any other thoughts
00:39:27.170 || 00:39:27.180 || about ways that Miles Franklin uh helps
00:39:34.190 || 00:39:34.200 || well you know I
00:39:36.170 || 00:39:36.180 || I mean I don't even know how to answer
00:39:37.730 || 00:39:37.740 || that I mean well one of the things one
00:39:38.930 || 00:39:38.940 || of the things that we've talked about in
00:39:42.530 || 00:39:42.540 || the past is the uh un uninteresting
00:39:44.750 || 00:39:44.760 || packaging on the shipping that kind of
00:39:45.770 || 00:39:45.780 || thing that nothing is going to raise
00:39:47.390 || 00:39:47.400 || anything or the multi-layered insurance
00:39:49.190 || 00:39:49.200 || method used in the shipping that kind of
00:39:51.230 || 00:39:51.240 || thing yeah I mean the Privacy has been
00:39:52.790 || 00:39:52.800 || the Cornerstone of our business since
00:39:55.250 || 00:39:55.260 || day one we started in the Swiss annuity
00:39:59.930 || 00:39:59.940 || business in 1989 and Swiss Francs and
00:40:02.150 || 00:40:02.160 || um you know privacy is the Cornerstone
00:40:04.550 || 00:40:04.560 || of of what the Swiss stand for always
00:40:06.950 || 00:40:06.960 || have anyway uh and it's the same thing
00:40:08.870 || 00:40:08.880 || here when you're talking Swiss Francs or
00:40:11.630 || 00:40:11.640 || precious metals people want privacy and
00:40:14.930 || 00:40:14.940 || inherently and we understand that so you
00:40:16.609 || 00:40:16.619 || bring up a good point in the way that we
00:40:18.589 || 00:40:18.599 || ship things so when we send a package
00:40:20.690 || 00:40:20.700 || it's in a very nondescript box it
00:40:22.550 || 00:40:22.560 || doesn't say miles Franklin on the
00:40:25.010 || 00:40:25.020 || outside typically it has the name of our
00:40:29.930 || 00:40:29.940 || vault manager as the uh the the from
00:40:32.150 || 00:40:32.160 || um and it will say something like Chris
00:40:34.970 || 00:40:34.980 || Olson on it but it won't it won't
00:40:37.609 || 00:40:37.619 || um have any identifying markings on it
00:40:40.250 || 00:40:40.260 || and we ensure it through UPS let's say
00:40:42.290 || 00:40:42.300 || it's a five thousand dollar package of
00:40:45.109 || 00:40:45.119 || Silver Eagles we will ensure it maybe
00:40:47.510 || 00:40:47.520 || for a hundred and fifty dollars and do
00:40:50.270 || 00:40:50.280 || adult signature required so that the UPS
00:40:51.950 || 00:40:51.960 || driver takes special care of that
00:40:54.050 || 00:40:54.060 || package that's minimalistically insured
00:40:55.550 || 00:40:55.560 || with adult signature required won't
00:40:57.530 || 00:40:57.540 || throw in the back of his truck the way
00:41:00.230 || 00:41:00.240 || he might with the Amazon cargo that he
00:41:02.690 || 00:41:02.700 || has and then Lloyds of London and
00:41:04.490 || 00:41:04.500 || travelers insurance company and others
00:41:07.550 || 00:41:07.560 || have programs that mesh with the UPS
00:41:09.589 || 00:41:09.599 || tracking software so that it is fully
00:41:12.230 || 00:41:12.240 || insured until it is signed for but the
00:41:15.410 || 00:41:15.420 || even the driver has no idea that a
00:41:17.270 || 00:41:17.280 || package that has no identified markings
00:41:19.730 || 00:41:19.740 || is packaged exquisitely well you need an
00:41:21.710 || 00:41:21.720 || ice pick or a jackhammer to open it up
00:41:25.430 || 00:41:25.440 || uh and is insured supplementally for the
00:41:27.530 || 00:41:27.540 || real value those are the things that we
00:41:29.750 || 00:41:29.760 || will try to do to enhance privacy it's a
00:41:32.230 || 00:41:32.240 || big deal I I
00:41:34.670 || 00:41:34.680 || privacy is something that I you know I
00:41:36.710 || 00:41:36.720 || just take for granted I live in a in a
00:41:37.670 || 00:41:37.680 || community
00:41:38.390 || 00:41:38.400 || um
00:41:41.690 || 00:41:41.700 || a golf community in Florida I've met a
00:41:43.310 || 00:41:43.320 || lot of people and done business with
00:41:46.550 || 00:41:46.560 || some of them who've approached me a
00:41:48.230 || 00:41:48.240 || couple of them watched these podcasts
00:41:50.569 || 00:41:50.579 || before I even knew who they were it was
00:41:53.450 || 00:41:53.460 || kind of kind of funny but I don't even
00:41:54.950 || 00:41:54.960 || tell any of the other people their
00:41:56.930 || 00:41:56.940 || friends have I mean it's just it's I
00:41:58.430 || 00:41:58.440 || it's I don't even think twice about it
00:42:00.349 || 00:42:00.359 || privacy is something we take very
00:42:02.089 || 00:42:02.099 || seriously
00:42:04.130 || 00:42:04.140 || um and and everyone should and that goes
00:42:06.230 || 00:42:06.240 || both ways you know you want to show
00:42:08.990 || 00:42:09.000 || someone how cool this is but you know
00:42:11.930 || 00:42:11.940 || loose lips sink ship ships and I think
00:42:15.770 || 00:42:15.780 || it's just important to uh realize that
00:42:18.230 || 00:42:18.240 || privacy is very very very important when
00:42:19.490 || 00:42:19.500 || you're safe guarding your precious
00:42:22.190 || 00:42:22.200 || metals and all it takes is one wrong
00:42:25.609 || 00:42:25.619 || person to hear one wrong thing and
00:42:28.550 || 00:42:28.560 || um yeah it's it's a big deal done again
00:42:30.109 || 00:42:30.119 || and something that we we don't take
00:42:41.930 || 00:42:41.940 || my fault uh before we wrap we almost
00:42:43.910 || 00:42:43.920 || forgot we have a weekly special to
00:42:45.349 || 00:42:45.359 || announce so if you could let people know
00:42:47.030 || 00:42:47.040 || what you've got cooking for them this

00:42:54.890 || 00:42:54.900 || 2022 Australian kangaroos for four and a
00:42:57.650 || 00:42:57.660 || quarter over the price of silver
00:43:01.309 || 00:43:01.319 || um they come in boxes at 250.
00:43:03.290 || 00:43:03.300 || um they're the only Sovereign Mint coin
00:43:06.710 || 00:43:06.720 || that comes in many mint boxes of 250. uh
00:43:09.349 || 00:43:09.359 || like the Canadian maple leaf they're the
00:43:12.230 || 00:43:12.240 || only other modern minted coin that is
00:43:14.630 || 00:43:14.640 || four nines nine nine nine nine they're
00:43:16.270 || 00:43:16.280 || the pure silver coins in the world

00:44:28.010 || 00:44:28.020 || there's more questions than I had time
00:44:29.829 || 00:44:29.839 || to uh
00:44:33.890 || 00:44:33.900 || answer uh Sarge 27 271 I really wanted
00:44:42.170 || 00:44:42.180 || yeah well you know what uh you know you
00:44:44.329 || 00:44:44.339 || can still buy a couple of ounces and
00:44:47.030 || 00:44:47.040 || anything is better than nothing and look
00:44:48.470 || 00:44:48.480 || you know I've been buying something
00:44:51.349 || 00:44:51.359 || every two weeks for 33 years and and I
00:44:53.230 || 00:44:53.240 || have never missed a two-week period ever
00:44:55.849 || 00:44:55.859 || as I've said that it was a promise to my
00:44:57.050 || 00:44:57.060 || father when we started this company
00:44:58.609 || 00:44:58.619 || there have been many two weeks where I
00:45:01.190 || 00:45:01.200 || spent 50 bucks whatever it is it's
00:45:04.490 || 00:45:04.500 || it's adding to the to the stash and uh
00:45:07.190 || 00:45:07.200 || as as I hope people understand I'm dead
00:45:08.809 || 00:45:08.819 || serious and sincere about that there's
00:45:11.150 || 00:45:11.160 || no there's no order minimum and I think
00:45:13.010 || 00:45:13.020 || where we are heading
00:45:15.829 || 00:45:15.839 || um anything that you could do to add to
00:45:18.650 || 00:45:18.660 || your stash is is going to be
00:45:21.650 || 00:45:21.660 || um it's going to be well received and
00:45:22.670 || 00:45:22.680 || look
00:45:24.589 || 00:45:24.599 || when we talk about silver the bottom
00:45:25.970 || 00:45:25.980 || line is this is that it's been
00:45:28.910 || 00:45:28.920 || controlled and kept too low for too long
00:45:32.270 || 00:45:32.280 || and it's greatly distorted the real
00:45:34.490 || 00:45:34.500 || Supply demand fundamentals in the real
00:45:38.089 || 00:45:38.099 || price and look in 2021 India will have
00:45:41.990 || 00:45:42.000 || imported about 4 500 tons of silver
00:45:46.849 || 00:45:46.859 || um and um that was you know at uh in
00:45:49.790 || 00:45:49.800 || 2021 in 2022 their numbers are up to 8
00:45:54.109 || 00:45:54.119 || 000. so you have 8 000 tons that is you
00:45:57.829 || 00:45:57.839 || have countries that are are accumulating
00:46:00.650 || 00:46:00.660 || vast amounts of silver you have the
00:46:02.150 || 00:46:02.160 || exchanges being bled down to their
00:46:04.849 || 00:46:04.859 || lowest levels ever 80 percent drawdown
00:46:07.130 || 00:46:07.140 || in registered Supply on on the comics
00:46:09.589 || 00:46:09.599 || since silver squeeze the lowest levels
00:46:12.530 || 00:46:12.540 || in the recorded history on the lme that
00:46:15.470 || 00:46:15.480 || is betraying anything else the biggest
00:46:17.390 || 00:46:17.400 || money in the world has been using the
00:46:20.390 || 00:46:20.400 || price suppression to to de-dollarize and
00:46:23.510 || 00:46:23.520 || it's not just gold it's silver too so so
00:46:25.910 || 00:46:25.920 || I think when it breaks even a couple
00:46:27.770 || 00:46:27.780 || ounces are are going to be a whole lot
00:46:31.010 || 00:46:31.020 || better than the 55 dollars that he has
00:46:33.290 || 00:46:33.300 || um you know now and I mean that
00:46:35.390 || 00:46:35.400 || sincerely so no order minimum whatever
00:46:37.130 || 00:46:37.140 || people want we're happy to help them any
00:46:38.569 || 00:46:38.579 || way we can
