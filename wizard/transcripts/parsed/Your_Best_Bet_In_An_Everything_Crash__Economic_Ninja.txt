00:00:17.330 || 00:00:17.340 || to see an uptick in that because of a
00:00:18.710 || 00:00:18.720 || currency transition that's happening

00:01:48.109 || 00:01:48.119 || be honest with you just as I was driving
00:01:50.210 || 00:01:50.220 || up and racing to get the interview I was
00:01:52.370 || 00:01:52.380 || literally feeling this feeling of
00:01:54.230 || 00:01:54.240 || exuberance inside and I know it sounds
00:01:55.730 || 00:01:55.740 || funny but it's this gut feeling about
00:01:57.469 || 00:01:57.479 || what's coming this next year even though
00:01:58.789 || 00:01:58.799 || there's some bad stuff there's also
00:02:00.350 || 00:02:00.360 || going to be a lot of good things
00:02:03.050 || 00:02:03.060 || yeah I mean we've had a crazy three
00:02:04.850 || 00:02:04.860 || years you know earlier since the
00:02:06.770 || 00:02:06.780 || beginning of 2020 with the pandemic and
00:02:09.050 || 00:02:09.060 || just the economy and the stock market
00:02:11.750 || 00:02:11.760 || has been going crazy up and down um what
00:02:13.729 || 00:02:13.739 || are your what are you most excited for
00:02:16.130 || 00:02:16.140 || and looking forward to you know even in
00:02:18.949 || 00:02:18.959 || the midst of Crisis here in 2023
00:02:20.030 || 00:02:20.040 || um what are you most looking forward to
00:02:21.290 || 00:02:21.300 || in this coming year
00:02:23.330 || 00:02:23.340 || so the last few years if it's taught us
00:02:24.589 || 00:02:24.599 || anything it's it's who we should or
00:02:26.210 || 00:02:26.220 || three years it's who we should be
00:02:27.890 || 00:02:27.900 || hanging out with who should we be
00:02:29.930 || 00:02:29.940 || associating ourselves with to say that
00:02:31.670 || 00:02:31.680 || there's been a divide among human beings
00:02:33.710 || 00:02:33.720 || around the world is an understatement
00:02:36.050 || 00:02:36.060 || and a divide of understanding and
00:02:38.690 || 00:02:38.700 || knowledge a divide of wisdom and a
00:02:41.690 || 00:02:41.700 || divide of of
00:02:45.290 || 00:02:45.300 || desire or lack thereof people have
00:02:46.910 || 00:02:46.920 || literally separated themselves into two
00:02:48.410 || 00:02:48.420 || camps no matter which way you want to
00:02:51.170 || 00:02:51.180 || put it politically economically socially
00:02:53.390 || 00:02:53.400 || it doesn't matter
00:02:55.790 || 00:02:55.800 || um what I'm excited about is that there
00:02:58.070 || 00:02:58.080 || are so many people that have woken up in
00:02:59.690 || 00:02:59.700 || the last three years really bad things
00:03:02.210 || 00:03:02.220 || have happened uh certain civil liberties
00:03:05.170 || 00:03:05.180 || been taken uh certain uh you know
00:03:07.670 || 00:03:07.680 || finances have been robbed some finances
00:03:08.869 || 00:03:08.879 || have been gained right we've seen
00:03:11.030 || 00:03:11.040 || explosions in uh precious metals we've
00:03:12.589 || 00:03:12.599 || seen explosions in crypto we've also
00:03:14.570 || 00:03:14.580 || seen downturns in both uh same thing
00:03:15.830 || 00:03:15.840 || with the stock market
00:03:19.550 || 00:03:19.560 || but so much knowledge was gained from
00:03:21.589 || 00:03:21.599 || all of this and there were people that I
00:03:23.690 || 00:03:23.700 || talked to on a daily basis that say
00:03:25.850 || 00:03:25.860 || things like I never knew how important
00:03:29.089 || 00:03:29.099 || it was to own an ounce of silver or I
00:03:31.190 || 00:03:31.200 || didn't even know what Gold's role was in
00:03:32.930 || 00:03:32.940 || the economy or what its history was
00:03:35.390 || 00:03:35.400 || throughout the ages uh there's so many
00:03:37.009 || 00:03:37.019 || people now that understand what a real
00:03:38.869 || 00:03:38.879 || estate cycle is and that it is
00:03:42.289 || 00:03:42.299 || repeatable and to me going into 2033
00:03:43.369 || 00:03:43.379 || because I believe there's going to be a
00:03:45.589 || 00:03:45.599 || much harder things coming because you
00:03:48.229 || 00:03:48.239 || know call it the powers of b or just the
00:03:51.110 || 00:03:51.120 || way you know uh economics flows through
00:03:53.449 || 00:03:53.459 || human emotion they're going to be hard
00:03:56.149 || 00:03:56.159 || times coming for those that aren't
00:03:57.410 || 00:03:57.420 || understanding what's coming on with that
00:03:59.149 || 00:03:59.159 || digital currency you know and there are
00:04:00.470 || 00:04:00.480 || banks around the world that want to get
00:04:02.149 || 00:04:02.159 || us into that digital currency and the
00:04:03.830 || 00:04:03.840 || only way to get us there is through fear
00:04:04.970 || 00:04:04.980 || right
00:04:06.410 || 00:04:06.420 || um but with that being said there's so
00:04:07.729 || 00:04:07.739 || many more people now that have an
00:04:09.710 || 00:04:09.720 || understanding of what's coming but
00:04:11.149 || 00:04:11.159 || what's going on and what's coming in the
00:04:12.470 || 00:04:12.480 || future and they're getting prepared for
00:04:14.330 || 00:04:14.340 || it so to be honest with you I get super
00:04:16.610 || 00:04:16.620 || pumped about that I know your whole
00:04:18.949 || 00:04:18.959 || channel is really about seeing the
00:04:22.009 || 00:04:22.019 || positive aspects of a crisis um so what
00:04:23.749 || 00:04:23.759 || kind of opportunities if you could
00:04:25.550 || 00:04:25.560 || expand on that do you see coming in this
00:04:27.830 || 00:04:27.840 || next year yeah you know I just filmed a
00:04:30.050 || 00:04:30.060 || video about real estate and a company
00:04:32.450 || 00:04:32.460 || called open door and somebody came out
00:04:34.310 || 00:04:34.320 || one of my subscribers came out and says
00:04:35.990 || 00:04:36.000 || look I know it I get it the real
00:04:37.670 || 00:04:37.680 || estate's gonna crash and it's crashing
00:04:39.830 || 00:04:39.840 || but the problem is I'm still seeing
00:04:42.710 || 00:04:42.720 || these crazy companies like Open Door buy
00:04:45.650 || 00:04:45.660 || these homes for insane amounts but he
00:04:47.510 || 00:04:47.520 || gave an example last month Open Door
00:04:48.770 || 00:04:48.780 || bought a house down the street from him
00:04:51.770 || 00:04:51.780 || for 850 000 they now have it listed for
00:04:53.390 || 00:04:53.400 || 710
00:04:55.610 || 00:04:55.620 || 000 the facts are there are
00:04:57.530 || 00:04:57.540 || opportunities all around us and even
00:04:59.270 || 00:04:59.280 || though this isn't in my opinion time to
00:05:01.670 || 00:05:01.680 || buy real estate that time is coming and
00:05:03.230 || 00:05:03.240 || to say that this is going to be a bigger
00:05:05.210 || 00:05:05.220 || opportunity in real estate than what we
00:05:08.330 || 00:05:08.340 || saw in between 2008 and 2010 is an
00:05:10.070 || 00:05:10.080 || understatement but a lot of people go
00:05:12.409 || 00:05:12.419 || how do I get there and I believe the
00:05:14.990 || 00:05:15.000 || transportation vehicle for your finances
00:05:17.090 || 00:05:17.100 || to get you from Zero to Hero in the real
00:05:18.710 || 00:05:18.720 || estate market during the next downturn
00:05:20.629 || 00:05:20.639 || is gonna be precious metals I believe
00:05:22.909 || 00:05:22.919 || that God's money is going to outshine
00:05:25.550 || 00:05:25.560 || Satan's money quite frankly and I
00:05:26.749 || 00:05:26.759 || believe that you're going to see an
00:05:28.909 || 00:05:28.919 || uptick in that because of a currency
00:05:30.830 || 00:05:30.840 || transition that's happening from paper
00:05:34.430 || 00:05:34.440 || Fiat to digital Fiat essentially it is
00:05:35.749 || 00:05:35.759 || very interesting because I remember last
00:05:37.249 || 00:05:37.259 || time we had you on you were talking
00:05:38.570 || 00:05:38.580 || about how
00:05:41.570 || 00:05:41.580 || the how you really have anticipated
00:05:44.150 || 00:05:44.160 || crises in the past and taken uh
00:05:46.610 || 00:05:46.620 || advantage of them but the coming crisis
00:05:49.550 || 00:05:49.560 || will kind of make those others pale in
00:05:52.550 || 00:05:52.560 || comparison because this crisis is a
00:05:53.930 || 00:05:53.940 || currency crisis so it's going to be
00:05:56.150 || 00:05:56.160 || bigger than any of the other um can you
00:05:58.070 || 00:05:58.080 || expand on kind of the crisis we're
00:06:00.230 || 00:06:00.240 || heading into and and why a currency
00:06:02.330 || 00:06:02.340 || crisis is different than the other ones
00:06:04.969 || 00:06:04.979 || in the past yeah so to understand where
00:06:06.290 || 00:06:06.300 || we are right now we have to understand
00:06:07.969 || 00:06:07.979 || where we came from let's talk about the
00:06:10.610 || 00:06:10.620 || two cycles before this the first uh
00:06:12.770 || 00:06:12.780 || bubble was the stock bubble the.com
00:06:14.510 || 00:06:14.520 || bubble that happened in the late 90s
00:06:17.810 || 00:06:17.820 || early 2000s I mean literally the year
00:06:21.290 || 00:06:21.300 || 2000 and early 2001. uh.com stocks led
00:06:23.330 || 00:06:23.340 || the pack but it also sucked in the Dow
00:06:26.330 || 00:06:26.340 || Jones average with it and literally took
00:06:29.510 || 00:06:29.520 || uh stock valuations to Crazy Heights uh
00:06:30.950 || 00:06:30.960 || fourteen thousand on the dial to give
00:06:33.230 || 00:06:33.240 || you an idea but then that bubble popped
00:06:35.749 || 00:06:35.759 || and the NASDAQ fell massively but the
00:06:38.090 || 00:06:38.100 || Dow Jones fell 50 right that was the
00:06:39.469 || 00:06:39.479 || point when I moved moved into the next
00:06:41.210 || 00:06:41.220 || bubble and I moved into real estate
00:06:43.370 || 00:06:43.380 || because the Federal Reserve had to act
00:06:45.110 || 00:06:45.120 || they had to stimulate the economy juice
00:06:47.390 || 00:06:47.400 || it if you will and juicing it is
00:06:49.370 || 00:06:49.380 || lowering rates that's their low hanging
00:06:50.570 || 00:06:50.580 || fruits one of the only things the
00:06:52.249 || 00:06:52.259 || federal conserve can do is manipulate
00:06:54.110 || 00:06:54.120 || interest rates and then deal with swap
00:06:56.210 || 00:06:56.220 || lines and hide where money is
00:06:58.909 || 00:06:58.919 || transferred so when they lowered rates I
00:07:00.830 || 00:07:00.840 || dove into that next cycle because I saw
00:07:04.010 || 00:07:04.020 || the human emotion of greed and jealousy
00:07:05.570 || 00:07:05.580 || get involved and I go people are going
00:07:08.090 || 00:07:08.100 || to want to out do their neighbor so
00:07:09.230 || 00:07:09.240 || they're going to want to buy a bigger
00:07:11.330 || 00:07:11.340 || house bigger cars things like that well
00:07:13.010 || 00:07:13.020 || that brought us to that next big wave
00:07:15.469 || 00:07:15.479 || but that was a real estate wave now when
00:07:18.529 || 00:07:18.539 || that broke that brought us into this big
00:07:21.589 || 00:07:21.599 || one and that is a currency wave now this
00:07:23.809 || 00:07:23.819 || is a wave that we haven't seen in Lily
00:07:26.930 || 00:07:26.940 || 100 years last time um we saw this
00:07:28.550 || 00:07:28.560 || currency wave is essentially when gold
00:07:31.550 || 00:07:31.560 || was demonetized and just for uh opinion
00:07:33.770 || 00:07:33.780 || I do not believe that we're gonna see
00:07:35.570 || 00:07:35.580 || um are not demonetized but actually you
00:07:37.189 || 00:07:37.199 || know illegal to own under that executive
00:07:39.350 || 00:07:39.360 || order I do not we're going to see that
00:07:40.850 || 00:07:40.860 || this time because what's happening is
00:07:42.950 || 00:07:42.960 || we're transitioning from paper paper
00:07:46.670 || 00:07:46.680 || Fiat into Fiat digital and for them to
00:07:48.770 || 00:07:48.780 || have a smooth transfer they need to be
00:07:50.570 || 00:07:50.580 || able to show that it's free it's Freedom
00:07:51.830 || 00:07:51.840 || they're going to be able to you're gonna
00:07:53.089 || 00:07:53.099 || be able to buy whatever you want with it
00:07:54.830 || 00:07:54.840 || it's going to be great you can buy gold
00:07:55.969 || 00:07:55.979 || if you want you could buy digital
00:07:57.230 || 00:07:57.240 || currency they're not going to like
00:07:59.029 || 00:07:59.039 || Bitcoin they're not going to advertise
00:08:00.529 || 00:08:00.539 || that but they're not going to limit it
00:08:03.589 || 00:08:03.599 || right because they know the facts 95 of
00:08:05.150 || 00:08:05.160 || the people are not going to take that
00:08:07.010 || 00:08:07.020 || new digital currency that they hand you
00:08:08.990 || 00:08:09.000 || during a crisis very similar to what
00:08:12.650 || 00:08:12.660 || happened in 2020 or what happened during
00:08:15.650 || 00:08:15.660 || uh QE time in 2008 where they're giving
00:08:17.809 || 00:08:17.819 || out money too to people that they deemed
00:08:19.790 || 00:08:19.800 || needed it uh they're not going to limit
00:08:21.290 || 00:08:21.300 || you and what you can buy because they
00:08:23.150 || 00:08:23.160 || know 95 of the people are just gonna go
00:08:24.650 || 00:08:24.660 || buy things they shouldn't buy more
00:08:27.230 || 00:08:27.240 || expensive cars Gucci handbags and things
00:08:29.589 || 00:08:29.599 || like that right hopefully some of them
00:08:31.969 || 00:08:31.979 || the subscribers on my channel will be
00:08:33.290 || 00:08:33.300 || paying off debt if they have any or
00:08:35.449 || 00:08:35.459 || taking it and buying God's money but
00:08:37.850 || 00:08:37.860 || that's where I think this is the biggest
00:08:40.130 || 00:08:40.140 || bubble there is and the reason why is
00:08:43.370 || 00:08:43.380 || because a currency crash involves all
00:08:46.070 || 00:08:46.080 || asset classes because it is what is used
00:08:49.430 || 00:08:49.440 || to buy any of the asset classes that is
00:08:50.810 || 00:08:50.820 || very interesting that you're saying that
00:08:52.850 || 00:08:52.860 || the currency crisis involves all asset
00:08:54.470 || 00:08:54.480 || classes and that's what I've been
00:08:56.449 || 00:08:56.459 || hearing for a while that this bubble
00:08:58.310 || 00:08:58.320 || that we're currently in is kind of a
00:09:00.350 || 00:09:00.360 || bubble of everything we're seeing real
00:09:01.670 || 00:09:01.680 || estate topping out we're seeing the
00:09:02.930 || 00:09:02.940 || stock market topping up we're seeing
00:09:05.630 || 00:09:05.640 || bonds possibly topping out
00:09:07.610 || 00:09:07.620 || um so I guess can you expand on that
00:09:08.990 || 00:09:09.000 || because it seems like this isn't
00:09:10.250 || 00:09:10.260 || something that really anybody alive
00:09:13.009 || 00:09:13.019 || today has seen before you're right and
00:09:14.509 || 00:09:14.519 || this is what's really truly exciting
00:09:15.650 || 00:09:15.660 || about this is because the Federal
00:09:17.030 || 00:09:17.040 || Reserve the reason why everything is
00:09:17.990 || 00:09:18.000 || popping out is because the Federal
00:09:19.850 || 00:09:19.860 || Reserve is raising rates right but
00:09:21.530 || 00:09:21.540 || really if you think about it it's not
00:09:23.329 || 00:09:23.339 || just the FED raising rates that's how
00:09:25.190 || 00:09:25.200 || they started but now what's really
00:09:27.410 || 00:09:27.420 || taking over is a 10-year bonds uh seeing
00:09:28.910 || 00:09:28.920 || some pressure to the upside because
00:09:31.610 || 00:09:31.620 || countries like Japan are having to sell
00:09:34.610 || 00:09:34.620 || some of their uh treasuries because they
00:09:36.470 || 00:09:36.480 || are forced to take that money
00:09:39.230 || 00:09:39.240 || and prop up their own currency so if you
00:09:40.970 || 00:09:40.980 || think about it as more countries like
00:09:42.350 || 00:09:42.360 || what's going on in Switzerland right now
00:09:43.730 || 00:09:43.740 || they have an emergency swap line that
00:09:45.290 || 00:09:45.300 || was set up with the FED because they're
00:09:47.090 || 00:09:47.100 || having issues with one of their main
00:09:48.889 || 00:09:48.899 || Banks right so as more and more
00:09:50.930 || 00:09:50.940 || countries have problem in China came out
00:09:52.610 || 00:09:52.620 || right after Japan I knew they jumped on
00:09:54.170 || 00:09:54.180 || that one said hey we're having problems
00:09:55.730 || 00:09:55.740 || too we may have to sell some treasuries
00:09:57.650 || 00:09:57.660 || it's because they want to sell
00:10:00.050 || 00:10:00.060 || treasuries they know the outcome if
00:10:01.370 || 00:10:01.380 || countries start selling their U.S
00:10:03.230 || 00:10:03.240 || treasuries right and if you think about
00:10:06.050 || 00:10:06.060 || it every day that goes by countries need
00:10:09.230 || 00:10:09.240 || U.S bonds U.S treasuries t-bills
00:10:11.329 || 00:10:11.339 || whatever less and less because they're
00:10:12.590 || 00:10:12.600 || starting to do business in their own
00:10:14.930 || 00:10:14.940 || currency we have lost the US dollar
00:10:17.150 || 00:10:17.160 || standard that was obvious when Saudi
00:10:18.949 || 00:10:18.959 || Arabia said hey we're out and not only
00:10:20.690 || 00:10:20.700 || are we out we're signing an agreement
00:10:22.250 || 00:10:22.260 || with China That's not only good for 50
00:10:25.009 || 00:10:25.019 || years but beyond that and I didn't see
00:10:27.590 || 00:10:27.600 || any bombs flying over in uh Saudi Arabia
00:10:29.990 || 00:10:30.000 || the next week like we did with countries
00:10:34.009 || 00:10:34.019 || like uh Iran or not Iran but uh Iraq and
00:10:36.410 || 00:10:36.420 || uh Libya right we've seen that have
00:10:38.449 || 00:10:38.459 || happened before When leaders challenge
00:10:40.610 || 00:10:40.620 || dollars Supremacy and trade we don't see
00:10:42.530 || 00:10:42.540 || that anymore so as countries start
00:10:44.269 || 00:10:44.279 || figuring the sound they go well wait a
00:10:45.470 || 00:10:45.480 || minute Saudi Arabia is still there the
00:10:47.090 || 00:10:47.100 || next week well maybe we'll do it too
00:10:49.370 || 00:10:49.380 || because we don't like inflation getting
00:10:51.230 || 00:10:51.240 || put on our shoulders as the Federal
00:10:54.050 || 00:10:54.060 || Reserve in the U.S just uh exports its
00:10:56.870 || 00:10:56.880 || inflation so as they start to sell their
00:11:00.170 || 00:11:00.180 || Savings of Treasury bonds what happens
00:11:02.389 || 00:11:02.399 || is who's left to buy them well mainly
00:11:04.190 || 00:11:04.200 || it's Federal Reserve or anyone in the
00:11:05.990 || 00:11:06.000 || U.S and that's going to put upward
00:11:07.550 || 00:11:07.560 || pressure on the tenure Bond and that's
00:11:08.990 || 00:11:09.000 || what happened when Japan announced that
00:11:11.150 || 00:11:11.160 || we saw that 10-year bond really start to
00:11:12.949 || 00:11:12.959 || move and I think you're going to see the
00:11:15.050 || 00:11:15.060 || Federal Reserve trying to Tamp these
00:11:17.930 || 00:11:17.940 || little fires out by you know doing swap
00:11:20.150 || 00:11:20.160 || lines between the two currencies to try
00:11:22.069 || 00:11:22.079 || and hide it but the fact of the matter
00:11:23.329 || 00:11:23.339 || is they're only going to be able to put
00:11:25.490 || 00:11:25.500 || out so many fires they can fix the Japan
00:11:27.590 || 00:11:27.600 || fire I don't know if they can fix the
00:11:29.509 || 00:11:29.519 || Chinese fire because China's got a lot
00:11:30.710 || 00:11:30.720 || of bonds
00:11:32.630 || 00:11:32.640 || um uh Russia also has them as they start
00:11:34.250 || 00:11:34.260 || to sell them and that increases that's
00:11:35.990 || 00:11:36.000 || going to cause interest rates to move
00:11:38.449 || 00:11:38.459 || even more which makes credit card
00:11:40.730 || 00:11:40.740 || borrowing more expensive auto loans more
00:11:42.530 || 00:11:42.540 || expensive and the biggest one the
00:11:44.690 || 00:11:44.700 || biggest wealth effect is homes and it's
00:11:46.130 || 00:11:46.140 || going to cause that 10-year bond to
00:11:47.810 || 00:11:47.820 || really go out of control so the question
00:11:50.690 || 00:11:50.700 || is it's not if it's when and then the
00:11:52.610 || 00:11:52.620 || other question is how much Bond
00:11:54.170 || 00:11:54.180 || purchases can the Federal Reserve take
00:11:55.490 || 00:11:55.500 || on its shoulders
00:11:58.069 || 00:11:58.079 || I think that is a key question there and
00:12:01.009 || 00:12:01.019 || may be the determining factor of where
00:12:02.630 || 00:12:02.640 || we're going to see inflation versus
00:12:04.670 || 00:12:04.680 || deflation because it would seem like if
00:12:06.650 || 00:12:06.660 || interest rates are going to be rising
00:12:09.470 || 00:12:09.480 || and a lot of bonds are going to be sold
00:12:11.449 || 00:12:11.459 || um then that would lead to it that would
00:12:14.329 || 00:12:14.339 || be a deflationary environment what is
00:12:15.829 || 00:12:15.839 || your perspective on that because I think
00:12:17.630 || 00:12:17.640 || there is that whole debate about are we
00:12:18.949 || 00:12:18.959 || going to be seeing deflation in
00:12:20.750 || 00:12:20.760 || inflation and it might be a bit of both
00:12:22.970 || 00:12:22.980 || actually because if we're seeing stocks
00:12:24.710 || 00:12:24.720 || fall and real estate fall that is
00:12:26.590 || 00:12:26.600 || deflationary at least in those sectors
00:12:29.389 || 00:12:29.399 || you are 100 correct people do not
00:12:31.310 || 00:12:31.320 || understand the fact that inflation and
00:12:32.990 || 00:12:33.000 || deflation happen at the exact same time
00:12:35.210 || 00:12:35.220 || I actually came out the video that
00:12:37.069 || 00:12:37.079 || started in the spring and I said
00:12:39.470 || 00:12:39.480 || deflation has begun and boy did I catch
00:12:41.810 || 00:12:41.820 || some crap for that because people in
00:12:43.910 || 00:12:43.920 || their minds expect things like one day
00:12:45.889 || 00:12:45.899 || the light switch goes on and goes oh we
00:12:47.509 || 00:12:47.519 || have inflation and then the next
00:12:49.069 || 00:12:49.079 || whenever it happens the light switch
00:12:50.509 || 00:12:50.519 || goes off and goes oh it's time for
00:12:52.550 || 00:12:52.560 || deflation but they don't understand I'll
00:12:55.910 || 00:12:55.920 || go back to 2008 and explain in 2006 when
00:12:57.710 || 00:12:57.720 || I was selling my homes the reason why I
00:12:59.150 || 00:12:59.160 || was liquidating all my homes I didn't
00:13:00.889 || 00:13:00.899 || have a lot back then I had 14 but that
00:13:02.870 || 00:13:02.880 || was a lot for my Social Circle that was
00:13:04.970 || 00:13:04.980 || the most that was the size of my Social
00:13:06.590 || 00:13:06.600 || Circle right
00:13:08.569 || 00:13:08.579 || um I was liquidating them super fast
00:13:10.610 || 00:13:10.620 || because days on Market were extending
00:13:13.670 || 00:13:13.680 || and so I knew that as sales started to
00:13:16.610 || 00:13:16.620 || wane and as inventory more homes hit the
00:13:18.170 || 00:13:18.180 || market it was going to become more and
00:13:20.150 || 00:13:20.160 || more difficult for me to sell and then
00:13:21.769 || 00:13:21.779 || there's that period of time and this
00:13:23.329 || 00:13:23.339 || happens in the real estate market stock
00:13:25.610 || 00:13:25.620 || market all kinds of different uh markets
00:13:27.829 || 00:13:27.839 || when all of a sudden the sales are
00:13:30.050 || 00:13:30.060 || getting so long it's taking so long to
00:13:31.850 || 00:13:31.860 || sell somebody decides to lower the price
00:13:33.829 || 00:13:33.839 || there's there we go that's the main
00:13:35.150 || 00:13:35.160 || destruction right there right because
00:13:37.430 || 00:13:37.440 || there's no longer any demand for the
00:13:38.690 || 00:13:38.700 || home so you go ahead and lower the price
00:13:40.310 || 00:13:40.320 || well then your neighbor goes well wait a
00:13:41.449 || 00:13:41.459 || minute he lowered his price we did the
00:13:42.769 || 00:13:42.779 || same price I want to sell mine before
00:13:44.629 || 00:13:44.639 || him so I've got a lower Buy price I
00:13:46.190 || 00:13:46.200 || gotta lower a little bit more and then
00:13:48.350 || 00:13:48.360 || that cascading effect that sell-off is
00:13:50.690 || 00:13:50.700 || what creates deflation well the facts
00:13:52.670 || 00:13:52.680 || are deflation and inflation happen at
00:13:54.769 || 00:13:54.779 || the exact same time as we're moving from
00:13:57.410 || 00:13:57.420 || an inflation area period to a
00:13:59.269 || 00:13:59.279 || deflationary period where everything's
00:14:01.129 || 00:14:01.139 || deflating at once it's not a light
00:14:02.389 || 00:14:02.399 || switch so you're a hundred percent
00:14:03.769 || 00:14:03.779 || correct when you say that you're going
00:14:05.629 || 00:14:05.639 || to see belts of both because that is
00:14:07.490 || 00:14:07.500 || where we are in the cycle I believe that
00:14:09.170 || 00:14:09.180 || we are going to see food and energy
00:14:11.930 || 00:14:11.940 || continue to inflate this year and other
00:14:13.850 || 00:14:13.860 || items like travel and Leisure
00:14:15.590 || 00:14:15.600 || subscription Services which are already
00:14:18.110 || 00:14:18.120 || in deflation uh and then it's going to
00:14:20.090 || 00:14:20.100 || move into other things like non-durable
00:14:23.930 || 00:14:23.940 || Goods uh consumer uh consumables things
00:14:25.550 || 00:14:25.560 || like the Gucci handbags things like that
00:14:27.050 || 00:14:27.060 || people that things that people don't
00:14:29.629 || 00:14:29.639 || need they're going to start to fall and
00:14:31.009 || 00:14:31.019 || then that's going to cause an even
00:14:32.569 || 00:14:32.579 || bigger wave because as those companies
00:14:34.550 || 00:14:34.560 || start to lay people off it's going to
00:14:36.710 || 00:14:36.720 || increase the unemployment rate and
00:14:37.970 || 00:14:37.980 || that's when the Federal Reserve is going
00:14:39.829 || 00:14:39.839 || to be excited Federal Reserve wants
00:14:41.509 || 00:14:41.519 || unemployment and then they're going to
00:14:43.009 || 00:14:43.019 || be able to do that about face but until
00:14:45.410 || 00:14:45.420 || then they have to literally break the
00:14:47.750 || 00:14:47.760 || markets and the sad thing is what's not
00:14:49.550 || 00:14:49.560 || set for you and me the Federal Reserve
00:14:52.129 || 00:14:52.139 || does not want to be blamed but I have a
00:14:53.870 || 00:14:53.880 || feeling because of this increase in
00:14:55.069 || 00:14:55.079 || knowledge that we talked about in the
00:14:58.009 || 00:14:58.019 || last year last couple of years more than
00:14:59.629 || 00:14:59.639 || less people are going to understand that
00:15:01.490 || 00:15:01.500 || Federal Reserve the private Central Bank
00:15:03.710 || 00:15:03.720 || is the blame for this when it comes to
00:15:05.509 || 00:15:05.519 || inflation and deflation happening at the
00:15:07.850 || 00:15:07.860 || same time that really gets to the
00:15:11.569 || 00:15:11.579 || opportunities then in in this uh crisis
00:15:13.970 || 00:15:13.980 || that we're seeing because if you invest
00:15:16.790 || 00:15:16.800 || in what is going up and then switch to
00:15:19.550 || 00:15:19.560 || what it has fallen right so you invest
00:15:21.350 || 00:15:21.360 || first in those inflationary assets and
00:15:23.810 || 00:15:23.820 || then take advantage of what has been in
00:15:26.449 || 00:15:26.459 || deflation then you can just grow your
00:15:28.069 || 00:15:28.079 || wealth exponentially is that kind of
00:15:29.150 || 00:15:29.160 || what you're talking about when you're
00:15:30.710 || 00:15:30.720 || talking about first investing in
00:15:32.210 || 00:15:32.220 || precious metals and then transitioning
00:15:36.230 || 00:15:36.240 || to maybe stocks real estate yes 100 see
00:15:39.170 || 00:15:39.180 || the truth is you should never be in an
00:15:41.629 || 00:15:41.639 || investment forever now over the long
00:15:44.150 || 00:15:44.160 || term does gold go up against the fiat
00:15:45.949 || 00:15:45.959 || currency absolutely because we all know
00:15:48.410 || 00:15:48.420 || that fiat currency completely gets uh
00:15:50.810 || 00:15:50.820 || dwindled down over time through money
00:15:53.210 || 00:15:53.220 || printing through the increase of more
00:15:54.829 || 00:15:54.839 || money right so yeah over the long term
00:15:56.689 || 00:15:56.699 || but you could also say the same thing
00:15:58.129 || 00:15:58.139 || for real estate real estate over the
00:16:00.710 || 00:16:00.720 || long term always goes up now sure those
00:16:02.150 || 00:16:02.160 || these little blips that could almost
00:16:04.490 || 00:16:04.500 || take you out and cause bankruptcy on the
00:16:06.170 || 00:16:06.180 || way up but the reason why real estate
00:16:08.509 || 00:16:08.519 || goes up over the long term is because of
00:16:09.949 || 00:16:09.959 || the destruction in the purchasing power
00:16:11.930 || 00:16:11.940 || of Any Given fiat currency around the
00:16:14.870 || 00:16:14.880 || world but if you understood cycles and
00:16:16.850 || 00:16:16.860 || you understood that gold and silver
00:16:20.030 || 00:16:20.040 || should be going up exponentially versus
00:16:22.970 || 00:16:22.980 || other uh Commodities like in this case
00:16:24.230 || 00:16:24.240 || real estate because real estate should
00:16:26.150 || 00:16:26.160 || be on the downturn as interest rates get
00:16:28.310 || 00:16:28.320 || higher and the cost of living gets more
00:16:30.350 || 00:16:30.360 || expensive so people can't afford that
00:16:32.269 || 00:16:32.279 || next more expensive house right so as
00:16:35.449 || 00:16:35.459 || that falls the ratio of what you can buy
00:16:37.790 || 00:16:37.800 || increases dramatically and that's you're
00:16:39.230 || 00:16:39.240 || absolutely right that is exactly what
00:16:40.249 || 00:16:40.259 || I'm talking about
00:16:42.710 || 00:16:42.720 || now it's not just I guess economically
00:16:44.689 || 00:16:44.699 || or financially that we want to prepare
00:16:46.910 || 00:16:46.920 || as well you've recently stated on your
00:16:49.370 || 00:16:49.380 || channel kind of other ways that as
00:16:50.689 || 00:16:50.699 || you're mentioning you know with this
00:16:52.850 || 00:16:52.860 || whole uh covet crisis and all the
00:16:54.230 || 00:16:54.240 || freedoms that have been taken away from
00:16:56.569 || 00:16:56.579 || us people are waking up and saying that
00:16:59.150 || 00:16:59.160 || something is wrong and going on uh you
00:17:01.069 || 00:17:01.079 || also mentioned on your channel recently
00:17:05.390 || 00:17:05.400 || about uh really the the metaverse um and
00:17:07.970 || 00:17:07.980 || the world economic Forum you know kind
00:17:09.530 || 00:17:09.540 || of talking more about that and how it's
00:17:10.850 || 00:17:10.860 || going to transform our life and
00:17:13.069 || 00:17:13.079 || everything and I guess what are some of
00:17:14.870 || 00:17:14.880 || the things that are people need to watch
00:17:17.329 || 00:17:17.339 || out for and say no to because a lot of
00:17:20.929 || 00:17:20.939 || these things are not just you know I
00:17:22.309 || 00:17:22.319 || guess taking away some of our Liberty
00:17:24.289 || 00:17:24.299 || but they they're actually just wrong
00:17:26.329 || 00:17:26.339 || yeah I completely agree so I did that
00:17:27.530 || 00:17:27.540 || video on the metaverse I said it's
00:17:29.270 || 00:17:29.280 || straight up demonic uh one of the
00:17:31.789 || 00:17:31.799 || biggest uh reasons I think people should
00:17:34.549 || 00:17:34.559 || be away uh steer clear from uh video
00:17:37.070 || 00:17:37.080 || games and things especially like Ai and
00:17:38.690 || 00:17:38.700 || uh these goggles that people are putting
00:17:40.669 || 00:17:40.679 || on is is first off it's a thief of your
00:17:42.650 || 00:17:42.660 || time and there is nothing worse than
00:17:44.810 || 00:17:44.820 || having time stolen from you because you
00:17:46.549 || 00:17:46.559 || cannot get that back I'll give an
00:17:48.350 || 00:17:48.360 || example I was out golfing with a buddy
00:17:49.490 || 00:17:49.500 || one day
00:17:51.169 || 00:17:51.179 || um I was pretty stressed out a lot going
00:17:52.909 || 00:17:52.919 || on in life uh and my buddies were
00:17:54.529 || 00:17:54.539 || calling me like hey you gotta get you
00:17:57.590 || 00:17:57.600 || know come Blossom steam and so we're out
00:18:00.710 || 00:18:00.720 || uh hitting the balls and golfing and he
00:18:02.390 || 00:18:02.400 || goes isn't this great and I go what do
00:18:03.470 || 00:18:03.480 || you mean because I had a lot going on
00:18:05.210 || 00:18:05.220 || I've got things going I mean we're
00:18:07.010 || 00:18:07.020 || absolutely crushing it in this in this
00:18:08.930 || 00:18:08.940 || day and age where there's all these
00:18:10.370 || 00:18:10.380 || opportunities around me and most people
00:18:12.169 || 00:18:12.179 || don't see them to me they're low-hanging
00:18:13.850 || 00:18:13.860 || fruit but to others they're non-existent
00:18:15.710 || 00:18:15.720 || he goes man isn't this great you're just
00:18:17.210 || 00:18:17.220 || sitting back and thinking about nothing
00:18:19.669 || 00:18:19.679 || today and I go no honestly I I think
00:18:21.650 || 00:18:21.660 || this is the worst use of my time
00:18:25.070 || 00:18:25.080 || possible and I I'm like I'm getting
00:18:26.810 || 00:18:26.820 || nothing accomplished life is literally
00:18:28.850 || 00:18:28.860 || passing Us by and where my buddies would
00:18:30.230 || 00:18:30.240 || sit there and go no this is great I'm
00:18:32.150 || 00:18:32.160 || checking talking out I go yeah you're
00:18:34.010 || 00:18:34.020 || checking out and so is your bank account
00:18:37.310 || 00:18:37.320 || and your your job I remember my buddies
00:18:40.549 || 00:18:40.559 || losing uh almost literally everything in
00:18:41.810 || 00:18:41.820 || the last cycle because they're all in
00:18:43.669 || 00:18:43.679 || construction and they're about to now
00:18:46.490 || 00:18:46.500 || and they want to check out and I go man
00:18:48.289 || 00:18:48.299 || you look at that you look at the
00:18:50.210 || 00:18:50.220 || metaverse and what people put their time
00:18:52.370 || 00:18:52.380 || into right now and it's just absolute
00:18:54.590 || 00:18:54.600 || Insanity sure Sports is great I played
00:18:56.150 || 00:18:56.160 || them in high school but I'm not going to
00:18:58.490 || 00:18:58.500 || blow my time every week watching sports
00:19:00.650 || 00:19:00.660 || or watching Netflix I want to hang out
00:19:02.750 || 00:19:02.760 || with real people that want to solve real
00:19:04.730 || 00:19:04.740 || problems and go crush it do I want to
00:19:07.010 || 00:19:07.020 || sit on a white sandy beach yes I do but
00:19:09.289 || 00:19:09.299 || I could do that and go help people at
00:19:11.630 || 00:19:11.640 || the same time so my thing is
00:19:14.930 || 00:19:14.940 || understanding what robs you of your time
00:19:17.810 || 00:19:17.820 || and that is one angle that honestly
00:19:19.850 || 00:19:19.860 || there are very wealthy people out there
00:19:22.130 || 00:19:22.140 || that have made a lot of money by robbing
00:19:23.990 || 00:19:24.000 || you of your time and selling you a
00:19:25.850 || 00:19:25.860 || subscription to Netflix and I'm not
00:19:28.010 || 00:19:28.020 || bagging on Netflix okay
00:19:29.570 || 00:19:29.580 || um I'm more of a Hallmark Channel guy
00:19:31.310 || 00:19:31.320 || quite frankly but my point thing is that
00:19:33.770 || 00:19:33.780 || uh I I think that people need to wake up
00:19:36.230 || 00:19:36.240 || and literally wake up get out of the
00:19:38.390 || 00:19:38.400 || Slumber get out of that uh Ready Player
00:19:40.669 || 00:19:40.679 || One sort of mentality and realize the
00:19:42.830 || 00:19:42.840 || plans of the elite are to dull you down
00:19:45.950 || 00:19:45.960 || and dumb you down and really get you to
00:19:48.890 || 00:19:48.900 || just be a good slave I think when it
00:19:50.210 || 00:19:50.220 || comes to
00:19:51.830 || 00:19:51.840 || um you know just enjoying life is so
00:19:53.990 || 00:19:54.000 || important but when it comes to the uh
00:19:55.430 || 00:19:55.440 || metaverse
00:19:57.529 || 00:19:57.539 || I mean that's just checking out it's
00:19:59.990 || 00:20:00.000 || almost like you know just uh drinking
00:20:02.450 || 00:20:02.460 || alcohol to escape the world right uh
00:20:03.890 || 00:20:03.900 || there's definitely a distinction there
00:20:07.190 || 00:20:07.200 || when you said uh the the checking out
00:20:10.789 || 00:20:10.799 || literally people physically say that and
00:20:12.110 || 00:20:12.120 || they don't realize that there's a
00:20:14.090 || 00:20:14.100 || problem with that they're checking out
00:20:15.169 || 00:20:15.179 || it's like
00:20:18.049 || 00:20:18.059 || where have we gone into alcohol is a
00:20:19.669 || 00:20:19.679 || great example it's like I just want to
00:20:21.470 || 00:20:21.480 || dull the pain I've literally heard
00:20:23.210 || 00:20:23.220 || people say that and I say
00:20:24.890 || 00:20:24.900 || there's there's an issue here like
00:20:26.510 || 00:20:26.520 || there's something deeper like we don't
00:20:28.909 || 00:20:28.919 || want to dull the pain we want to release
00:20:31.970 || 00:20:31.980 || the pain we want the pain gone I'll give
00:20:34.549 || 00:20:34.559 || an example I'm in a five-month
00:20:36.409 || 00:20:36.419 || sabbatical for my career right now I did
00:20:38.510 || 00:20:38.520 || a video about it I took a five month
00:20:40.610 || 00:20:40.620 || leave of absence without pay I saved up
00:20:42.770 || 00:20:42.780 || for it financially I could do that but I
00:20:44.930 || 00:20:44.940 || did it because I need to reset my mind I
00:20:47.810 || 00:20:47.820 || need to reset my family you know we want
00:20:50.090 || 00:20:50.100 || to work on things we want to get better
00:20:52.669 || 00:20:52.679 || and stronger for the future not weaker
00:20:54.950 || 00:20:54.960 || and Dumber and and I think that people
00:20:57.950 || 00:20:57.960 || need to stop dulling pain or checking
00:20:59.750 || 00:20:59.760 || out and they need to start dealing with
00:21:01.549 || 00:21:01.559 || the actual issues like we were
00:21:02.750 || 00:21:02.760 || mentioning before I think one of the
00:21:04.370 || 00:21:04.380 || really things the things I like about
00:21:06.650 || 00:21:06.660 || your channel is it's not just you know
00:21:08.450 || 00:21:08.460 || complaining about a crisis it's not just
00:21:10.070 || 00:21:10.080 || about complaining about what other
00:21:11.750 || 00:21:11.760 || people are doing it's about taking
00:21:14.450 || 00:21:14.460 || responsibility and this is one way that
00:21:15.770 || 00:21:15.780 || we can do that you know maybe the world
00:21:17.450 || 00:21:17.460 || economic forum is doing something maybe
00:21:19.190 || 00:21:19.200 || you know Facebook is doing something
00:21:20.570 || 00:21:20.580 || they're promoting things that we don't
00:21:22.549 || 00:21:22.559 || like but we can take responsibility of
00:21:24.650 || 00:21:24.660 || our own life life and our own finances
00:21:28.190 || 00:21:28.200 || as well if you could expand on that so
00:21:30.289 || 00:21:30.299 || and there's a lot to unbox there and I
00:21:31.549 || 00:21:31.559 || think it's very important let me let me
00:21:33.770 || 00:21:33.780 || step back here I met your family
00:21:36.529 || 00:21:36.539 || in Florida we were in Boca Raton and I
00:21:39.950 || 00:21:39.960 || was so absolutely impressed you're uh
00:21:42.289 || 00:21:42.299 || listen to your father getting to watch
00:21:45.590 || 00:21:45.600 || you and your brother uh you guys have
00:21:47.390 || 00:21:47.400 || something very special and I think you
00:21:49.850 || 00:21:49.860 || you are one of the rare instances of
00:21:53.750 || 00:21:53.760 || families in this country that spend time
00:21:55.850 || 00:21:55.860 || on learning about things that most
00:21:57.529 || 00:21:57.539 || people don't understand you yourself
00:22:00.529 || 00:22:00.539 || your father I've watched you uh not only
00:22:04.130 || 00:22:04.140 || learn about truth and facts in this the
00:22:05.090 || 00:22:05.100 || things that are going on in this world
00:22:07.130 || 00:22:07.140 || but you've taken that and you're sharing
00:22:09.470 || 00:22:09.480 || it with others and you're making a
00:22:10.730 || 00:22:10.740 || difference
00:22:12.830 || 00:22:12.840 || there are very few people out there
00:22:14.090 || 00:22:14.100 || doing that and I've been trying to
00:22:16.430 || 00:22:16.440 || encourage that in my channel as well to
00:22:18.830 || 00:22:18.840 || to go and help people right now the
00:22:20.570 || 00:22:20.580 || problem is most people start with their
00:22:21.770 || 00:22:21.780 || friends and family those are the two
00:22:23.210 || 00:22:23.220 || groups of people that will completely
00:22:25.430 || 00:22:25.440 || cut you down or or make funnier right
00:22:27.110 || 00:22:27.120 || honestly most of it's because of
00:22:29.029 || 00:22:29.039 || jealousy but there's something when
00:22:31.010 || 00:22:31.020 || we're talking about uh making ourselves
00:22:33.710 || 00:22:33.720 || better uh not checking out not dulling
00:22:36.049 || 00:22:36.059 || the pain when you go and help others it
00:22:38.270 || 00:22:38.280 || is not only help for them it is therapy
00:22:40.789 || 00:22:40.799 || for you as well and I'm living proof of
00:22:41.930 || 00:22:41.940 || this
00:22:43.610 || 00:22:43.620 || um and I think it's very important that
00:22:45.649 || 00:22:45.659 || we continue to strive not only for
00:22:48.830 || 00:22:48.840 || excellence for us but for others and in
00:22:51.470 || 00:22:51.480 || that helping other people we become
00:22:54.289 || 00:22:54.299 || whole we become more satisfied with life
00:22:56.510 || 00:22:56.520 || and as we do that if we share truth
00:22:58.190 || 00:22:58.200 || knowledge and love
00:22:59.810 || 00:22:59.820 || it's going to come back to us tenfold
00:23:01.549 || 00:23:01.559 || and I believe that this movement is
00:23:04.970 || 00:23:04.980 || going to grow Harder Faster stronger and
00:23:06.289 || 00:23:06.299 || I've always said it before it doesn't
00:23:08.390 || 00:23:08.400 || take an army to take a city it only
00:23:11.149 || 00:23:11.159 || takes a few good men and women and
00:23:13.070 || 00:23:13.080 || that's been proven uh times and times
00:23:16.789 || 00:23:16.799 || before good thinking hearted people with
00:23:19.250 || 00:23:19.260 || heart to to make something amazing
00:23:21.169 || 00:23:21.179 || happen and I literally going back to the
00:23:23.750 || 00:23:23.760 || first question in 2023 that's what's
00:23:25.310 || 00:23:25.320 || getting me excited because I'm meeting
00:23:28.010 || 00:23:28.020 || more and more people like yourself
00:23:29.750 || 00:23:29.760 || that are making a difference and
00:23:31.310 || 00:23:31.320 || literally starting to really explode in
00:23:33.950 || 00:23:33.960 || life and I think one of the things is
00:23:35.930 || 00:23:35.940 || that you know you don't have to have a
00:23:37.490 || 00:23:37.500 || YouTube channel that might it's
00:23:38.810 || 00:23:38.820 || interesting like having a YouTube
00:23:40.610 || 00:23:40.620 || channel might like what we're doing
00:23:43.130 || 00:23:43.140 || might be kind of a little bit effective
00:23:45.230 || 00:23:45.240 || but I think the most important thing is
00:23:46.730 || 00:23:46.740 || really the relationships in your own
00:23:49.310 || 00:23:49.320 || life is really being an example to
00:23:51.409 || 00:23:51.419 || people you know taking responsibility
00:23:54.110 || 00:23:54.120 || for your finances for your life there I
00:23:55.549 || 00:23:55.559 || think that's really the most important
00:23:57.289 || 00:23:57.299 || thing anything you do online is kind of
00:23:59.810 || 00:23:59.820 || secondary so all the people uh watching
00:24:01.610 || 00:24:01.620 || right now I think really that's the most
00:24:02.930 || 00:24:02.940 || important thing
00:24:05.149 || 00:24:05.159 || um in 2023 is to really take
00:24:08.390 || 00:24:08.400 || responsibility in the face of Crisis
00:24:10.789 || 00:24:10.799 || um this year you know let me add to that
00:24:13.250 || 00:24:13.260 || too I believe that we are called not to
00:24:15.710 || 00:24:15.720 || be borrowers but be lenders and that's
00:24:17.570 || 00:24:17.580 || not only a monetary statement but I
00:24:19.610 || 00:24:19.620 || think a life statement we're here to be
00:24:21.770 || 00:24:21.780 || a solid rock to other people how do you
00:24:23.630 || 00:24:23.640 || become a solid rock for other people is
00:24:25.010 || 00:24:25.020 || you need to be a solid rock for yourself
00:24:26.930 || 00:24:26.940 || and your family first first and foremost
00:24:29.090 || 00:24:29.100 || so like you said how you live your life
00:24:32.149 || 00:24:32.159 || is how others are going to perceive you
00:24:34.070 || 00:24:34.080 || and and be able to learn and glean for
00:24:35.270 || 00:24:35.280 || you not everyone's going to be able to
00:24:36.230 || 00:24:36.240 || right
00:24:38.750 || 00:24:38.760 || um but you're only going to attract the
00:24:41.090 || 00:24:41.100 || best type of human being around you so
00:24:43.549 || 00:24:43.559 || if you're in a bad Social Circle look to
00:24:46.190 || 00:24:46.200 || get out of it look to upgrade your life
00:24:48.409 || 00:24:48.419 || but you have to remember it starts with
00:24:50.990 || 00:24:51.000 || you first and foremost and then when you
00:24:52.789 || 00:24:52.799 || change you and you become that better
00:24:54.649 || 00:24:54.659 || version of you and you start to upgrade
00:24:56.570 || 00:24:56.580 || you're going to help yourself and other
