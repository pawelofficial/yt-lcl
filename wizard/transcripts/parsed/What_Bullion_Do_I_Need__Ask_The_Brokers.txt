00:00:35.389 || 00:00:35.399 || question we've thrown out there tonight
00:00:38.450 || 00:00:38.460 || was what kind of bullion is right for me
00:00:41.330 || 00:00:41.340 || but first I'd like to also uh give my
00:00:43.549 || 00:00:43.559 || son Elijah a chance to introduce himself
00:00:45.830 || 00:00:45.840 || yeah I'm Elijah K Johnson here another
00:00:47.810 || 00:00:47.820 || host of Liberty and finance and also a
00:00:49.490 || 00:00:49.500 || miles Franklin broker along with my
00:00:52.310 || 00:00:52.320 || father done again here
00:00:54.650 || 00:00:54.660 || and the the first question we really
00:00:56.869 || 00:00:56.879 || wanted to ask and kind of answer here is
00:00:58.970 || 00:00:58.980 || you know what kind of bullying do we
00:00:59.750 || 00:00:59.760 || need
00:01:01.790 || 00:01:01.800 || um and I think it can be kind of
00:01:03.349 || 00:01:03.359 || intimidating because there are so many
00:01:05.329 || 00:01:05.339 || different kinds of bullying out there
00:01:08.270 || 00:01:08.280 || there's coins bars from so many mints
00:01:09.710 || 00:01:09.720 || it's hard to count
00:01:11.210 || 00:01:11.220 || um and if someone is just getting
00:01:13.130 || 00:01:13.140 || started I know I've had a lot of clients
00:01:15.590 || 00:01:15.600 || call me and are kind of bewildered of
00:01:18.410 || 00:01:18.420 || you know where do I even start I think
00:01:21.050 || 00:01:21.060 || there are some basic principles to
00:01:23.390 || 00:01:23.400 || really go by here
00:01:26.149 || 00:01:26.159 || um and when it comes to kind of just
00:01:27.830 || 00:01:27.840 || breaking it down first you know you have
00:01:29.330 || 00:01:29.340 || the two main Metals gold and silver
00:01:32.870 || 00:01:32.880 || right and then you have to ask yourself
00:01:35.270 || 00:01:35.280 || um what size of product do you want and
00:01:36.770 || 00:01:36.780 || then also
00:01:38.990 || 00:01:39.000 || um do I want a government Mint or a
00:01:40.730 || 00:01:40.740 || private mint those are really the only
00:01:43.010 || 00:01:43.020 || questions you have to ask yourself and
00:01:45.410 || 00:01:45.420 || to make it super simple here so if you
00:01:47.749 || 00:01:47.759 || have coins those are government minted
00:01:49.609 || 00:01:49.619 || right and they have a face value on them
00:01:52.249 || 00:01:52.259 || they're very uh helpful because they're
00:01:54.050 || 00:01:54.060 || a small denomination and they're
00:01:55.609 || 00:01:55.619 || recognized around the world you know
00:01:57.590 || 00:01:57.600 || there are six major mints out there if
00:01:59.510 || 00:01:59.520 || you have a coin from one of those you
00:02:01.010 || 00:02:01.020 || know pretty much any major Boolean
00:02:02.510 || 00:02:02.520 || dealer any major bullion dealer will
00:02:04.010 || 00:02:04.020 || recognize them
00:02:06.289 || 00:02:06.299 || um and then you have the bars right and
00:02:08.510 || 00:02:08.520 || there are numerous private mints the
00:02:10.790 || 00:02:10.800 || advantage of the bars is that they have
00:02:12.410 || 00:02:12.420 || a lower premium
00:02:14.210 || 00:02:14.220 || um and so they're typically you know 10
00:02:17.570 || 00:02:17.580 || ounces a kilogram 100 ounces for silver
00:02:19.550 || 00:02:19.560 || or they're going to be you know one
00:02:21.530 || 00:02:21.540 || ounce to a kilogram for gold
00:02:23.750 || 00:02:23.760 || um and the advantage of the bar again is
00:02:25.670 || 00:02:25.680 || you're paying you're getting more gold
00:02:27.350 || 00:02:27.360 || and silver for your dollar and that's a
00:02:29.570 || 00:02:29.580 || really fantastic thing the thing to
00:02:32.089 || 00:02:32.099 || remember is that if you're buying it for
00:02:34.430 || 00:02:34.440 || less you're also selling it back for
00:02:35.449 || 00:02:35.459 || Less
00:02:36.890 || 00:02:36.900 || um but if you're really just looking to
00:02:39.770 || 00:02:39.780 || invest in the metal itself and you have
00:02:42.589 || 00:02:42.599 || a good amount of funds to invest bars
00:02:44.150 || 00:02:44.160 || are fantastic way to do it because you
00:02:46.009 || 00:02:46.019 || get the most metal for your dollar and
00:02:47.869 || 00:02:47.879 || if you have enough funds you can still
00:02:50.270 || 00:02:50.280 || have quite a bit of divisibility there
00:02:51.710 || 00:02:51.720 || um so you really don't need the one
00:02:53.869 || 00:02:53.879 || ounce product if you have a lot of funds
00:02:56.030 || 00:02:56.040 || to invest but uh done again what other
00:02:57.949 || 00:02:57.959 || thoughts do you have just initially on
00:03:00.470 || 00:03:00.480 || the kinds of metals to invest in well
00:03:01.970 || 00:03:01.980 || the other thing that occurs to me that I
00:03:04.250 || 00:03:04.260 || often talk with clients about when they
00:03:06.110 || 00:03:06.120 || ask me that question is what what is the
00:03:08.930 || 00:03:08.940 || right side especially uh people who have
00:03:12.170 || 00:03:12.180 || never been owning bullion before who've
00:03:14.630 || 00:03:14.640 || never perhaps ever bought gold or silver
00:03:16.130 || 00:03:16.140 || they may have a coin collection left
00:03:17.930 || 00:03:17.940 || over from their their you know handed
00:03:19.309 || 00:03:19.319 || down from their dad or uncle or
00:03:20.750 || 00:03:20.760 || something like that but if they're just
00:03:24.050 || 00:03:24.060 || starting to collect bullion to protect
00:03:25.970 || 00:03:25.980 || their family I always come at it from a
00:03:28.130 || 00:03:28.140 || Purpose Driven standpoint rather than a
00:03:30.589 || 00:03:30.599 || product driven standpoint and so again
00:03:32.330 || 00:03:32.340 || from my background with reluctant
00:03:33.770 || 00:03:33.780 || Preppers which was the old name of our
00:03:36.649 || 00:03:36.659 || Channel I always ask people to help me
00:03:38.509 || 00:03:38.519 || understand their purpose and what's
00:03:41.210 || 00:03:41.220 || driving them what their what's uh goal
00:03:42.890 || 00:03:42.900 || will look like success for them if we
00:03:45.170 || 00:03:45.180 || get it accomplished for them and usually
00:03:48.589 || 00:03:48.599 || I try to ask for them personally is
00:03:52.729 || 00:03:52.739 || protection and hedging and insurance and
00:03:55.610 || 00:03:55.620 || safety outside the banking system their
00:03:57.770 || 00:03:57.780 || number one you know protection from the
00:03:59.509 || 00:03:59.519 || currency destruction of inflation or
00:04:02.330 || 00:04:02.340 || protection from uh bank failure risk or
00:04:03.770 || 00:04:03.780 || protection from destruction of the
00:04:05.809 || 00:04:05.819 || dollar that sort of thing if that's
00:04:08.030 || 00:04:08.040 || their number one driving concern is that
00:04:11.929 || 00:04:11.939 || is that value of hedging and insurance
00:04:14.869 || 00:04:14.879 || and protection outside the system then
00:04:17.090 || 00:04:17.100 || it guides me to emphasize help guide
00:04:19.009 || 00:04:19.019 || them towards gold as the premier asset
00:04:22.090 || 00:04:22.100 || for that or if they're also
00:04:25.189 || 00:04:25.199 || comparatively high priority on potential
00:04:28.610 || 00:04:28.620 || appreciation and investment gains that
00:04:30.530 || 00:04:30.540 || silver might offer even if they're
00:04:31.790 || 00:04:31.800 || willing to tolerate some of the
00:04:33.710 || 00:04:33.720 || volatility then we talk a little bit
00:04:35.990 || 00:04:36.000 || about silver and that's been a lot more
00:04:38.890 || 00:04:38.900 || interesting to people recently because
00:04:43.070 || 00:04:43.080 || of the unusual low price of silver
00:04:44.749 || 00:04:44.759 || relative to gold or you putting it the
00:04:46.550 || 00:04:46.560 || other way the high gold to Silver ratio
00:04:49.850 || 00:04:49.860 || which is at almost a generational uh
00:04:51.770 || 00:04:51.780 || high right now which means you can get
00:04:54.050 || 00:04:54.060 || more ounces of silver compared to gold
00:04:55.550 || 00:04:55.560 || for the same price than you could at
00:04:57.710 || 00:04:57.720 || almost any other time with a rare
00:04:59.749 || 00:04:59.759 || exception of during the covid crisis for
00:05:01.670 || 00:05:01.680 || example so that's one thing and then we
00:05:04.670 || 00:05:04.680 || we talk about the the usefulness the
00:05:09.290 || 00:05:09.300 || utility of small sizes of coins like
00:05:12.350 || 00:05:12.360 || junk silver dimes and quarters for the
00:05:14.450 || 00:05:14.460 || purpose again a purpose-driven question
00:05:17.150 || 00:05:17.160 || of bartering or emergency local
00:05:20.150 || 00:05:20.160 || purchases for you know food at a
00:05:22.249 || 00:05:22.259 || farmer's market or for fuel or for or
00:05:25.249 || 00:05:25.259 || repairs or for services or that kind of
00:05:26.810 || 00:05:26.820 || thing in their local community having
00:05:29.510 || 00:05:29.520 || some of that on hand and then
00:05:31.189 || 00:05:31.199 || also when you mentioned the difference
00:05:32.230 || 00:05:32.240 || between
00:05:37.070 || 00:05:37.080 || bars and versus coins and size yes you
00:05:40.730 || 00:05:40.740 || can get a cheaper per ounce and bars but
00:05:42.590 || 00:05:42.600 || you don't want to start there because if
00:05:45.170 || 00:05:45.180 || you start with a 100 ounce silver bar or
00:05:46.850 || 00:05:46.860 || heaven forbid a thousand ounce silver
00:05:49.310 || 00:05:49.320 || bar or kilogram size gold bar as your
00:05:51.350 || 00:05:51.360 || very first thing and that's your whole
00:05:54.170 || 00:05:54.180 || nest egg right there then it's very
00:05:57.170 || 00:05:57.180 || limiting and inflexible in what you can
00:05:58.550 || 00:05:58.560 || do with it down the road so always
00:06:00.830 || 00:06:00.840 || thinking a few steps ahead there's so
00:06:03.550 || 00:06:03.560 || many unknowns in this preparedness
00:06:05.810 || 00:06:05.820 || scenario playing that we try to do we
00:06:07.670 || 00:06:07.680 || try to think several steps down the road
00:06:10.670 || 00:06:10.680 || and say well what kinds of scenarios are
00:06:12.409 || 00:06:12.419 || you trying to prepare for and how will
00:06:14.689 || 00:06:14.699 || these different types of Boolean assist
00:06:16.730 || 00:06:16.740 || you the most flexibly give you the most
00:06:19.450 || 00:06:19.460 || options and the most
00:06:22.249 || 00:06:22.259 || optionality the most we keep open the
00:06:24.950 || 00:06:24.960 || most widest universe of trading partners
00:06:28.129 || 00:06:28.139 || potential trading partners and put trust
00:06:30.110 || 00:06:30.120 || in the next person's mind so that is not
00:06:31.909 || 00:06:31.919 || something you're hassling with in a
00:06:34.129 || 00:06:34.139 || moment of stress or reduced stress so we
00:06:36.110 || 00:06:36.120 || can talk more about how either
00:06:38.689 || 00:06:38.699 || government minted coins versus private
00:06:41.809 || 00:06:41.819 || minted bars and play into all those or
00:06:43.370 || 00:06:43.380 || if somebody comes and says hey I'm
00:06:46.189 || 00:06:46.199 || rolling over a big 401k or an IRA into
00:06:47.870 || 00:06:47.880 || physical precious metals I've got this
00:06:51.230 || 00:06:51.240 || large you know six or seven figures
00:06:53.390 || 00:06:53.400 || um the number that they're working with
00:06:56.210 || 00:06:56.220 || then bars are completely a much better
00:06:57.890 || 00:06:57.900 || fit for something like that because they
00:07:01.129 || 00:07:01.139 || can take a lot of value and still not
00:07:03.830 || 00:07:03.840 || each represent too much of a of a
00:07:06.230 || 00:07:06.240 || percentage of your overall Nest Egg when
00:07:07.430 || 00:07:07.440 || it comes time to start taking
00:07:10.430 || 00:07:10.440 || distributions liquidation Etc so lots of
00:07:11.689 || 00:07:11.699 || different considerations but I always
00:07:13.330 || 00:07:13.340 || come at it from a functional
00:07:16.790 || 00:07:16.800 || preparedness and purpose-driven
00:07:18.590 || 00:07:18.600 || standpoint rather than a product driven
00:07:20.330 || 00:07:20.340 || standpoint that's just the way that I've
00:07:21.830 || 00:07:21.840 || tended to approach it
00:07:23.570 || 00:07:23.580 || yeah and I think I mean in life in
00:07:25.670 || 00:07:25.680 || general starting with the why I think is
00:07:28.550 || 00:07:28.560 || so important and I think what you uh
00:07:31.850 || 00:07:31.860 || brought up Dad is that um the importance
00:07:34.010 || 00:07:34.020 || of looking at the functionality of the
00:07:35.629 || 00:07:35.639 || different types of bullying and you can
00:07:38.450 || 00:07:38.460 || kind of think of that as you know
00:07:40.309 || 00:07:40.319 || um first and foremost why are you
00:07:42.650 || 00:07:42.660 || investing in blend typically people
00:07:45.409 || 00:07:45.419 || um and what is the what does the
00:07:46.670 || 00:07:46.680 || advantage of having what is the
00:07:48.409 || 00:07:48.419 || advantage of it having bling typically
00:07:51.230 || 00:07:51.240 || the first initial reason people are
00:07:53.870 || 00:07:53.880 || looking to invest in bullying is to get
00:07:55.490 || 00:07:55.500 || outside of the system have something of
00:07:57.710 || 00:07:57.720 || real value something that has survived
00:07:59.450 || 00:07:59.460 || the test of time you know for you know
00:08:01.249 || 00:08:01.259 || how many thousands of years it's always
00:08:04.249 || 00:08:04.259 || had value and if you look at any of the
00:08:05.689 || 00:08:05.699 || bullying you can get out there just get
00:08:07.610 || 00:08:07.620 || something and that that will fulfill
00:08:09.770 || 00:08:09.780 || that purpose then so you go like to the
00:08:12.710 || 00:08:12.720 || next purpose of well the divisibility
00:08:14.150 || 00:08:14.160 || right how can how am I going to sell
00:08:16.790 || 00:08:16.800 || back how how what am I going to barter
00:08:19.189 || 00:08:19.199 || with this those kinds of questions kind
00:08:21.890 || 00:08:21.900 || of come later then and get to those more
00:08:24.589 || 00:08:24.599 || specific products um so like the the
00:08:27.110 || 00:08:27.120 || divisibility rate you mentioned the 100
00:08:30.230 || 00:08:30.240 || ounce bars versus the one ounce coins so
00:08:32.329 || 00:08:32.339 || you can kind of funnel down and get to
00:08:34.550 || 00:08:34.560 || those more specific questions and get to
00:08:36.469 || 00:08:36.479 || exactly what you're looking for and we
00:08:37.909 || 00:08:37.919 || can definitely help you with that over
00:08:39.949 || 00:08:39.959 || the phone but I think just remembering
00:08:43.310 || 00:08:43.320 || that um it's better to have bullying
00:08:45.170 || 00:08:45.180 || than not right
00:08:46.790 || 00:08:46.800 || um because it gives you that protection
00:08:48.590 || 00:08:48.600 || and then kind of consider those other
00:08:51.470 || 00:08:51.480 || questions and scenarios after that we do
00:08:55.009 || 00:08:55.019 || have a question here from a viewer and
00:08:57.769 || 00:08:57.779 || they ask would there be any at all uh
00:08:59.810 || 00:08:59.820 || any advantage of coin of the realm
00:09:02.630 || 00:09:02.640 || bullion versus generic rounds so to kind
00:09:05.090 || 00:09:05.100 || of explain uh what that means we're
00:09:07.730 || 00:09:07.740 || looking at for example there are a lot
00:09:10.490 || 00:09:10.500 || of private mints around the US like
00:09:13.190 || 00:09:13.200 || sunshine mint there's a Japanese brand
00:09:15.470 || 00:09:15.480 || Asahi there's Pam Swiss there are all
00:09:17.930 || 00:09:17.940 || these uh private mints and they
00:09:19.610 || 00:09:19.620 || sometimes create one ounce rounds that
00:09:21.230 || 00:09:21.240 || look just like coins but they don't have
00:09:23.269 || 00:09:23.279 || a face value but they still say you know
00:09:25.250 || 00:09:25.260 || one ounce of silver on there and then
00:09:27.530 || 00:09:27.540 || there's also coin coins of the realm
00:09:29.690 || 00:09:29.700 || right so whatever your whatever country
00:09:31.310 || 00:09:31.320 || you're in
00:09:33.050 || 00:09:33.060 || um that government may make bullion
00:09:34.970 || 00:09:34.980 || coins so for example in the US the US
00:09:37.370 || 00:09:37.380 || government makes silver eagles Gold
00:09:40.490 || 00:09:40.500 || Eagles one ounce size and the viewers
00:09:42.650 || 00:09:42.660 || wanting to know you know is it is there
00:09:44.690 || 00:09:44.700 || an advantage to the government minted
00:09:47.810 || 00:09:47.820 || coin from your country than just a
00:09:49.970 || 00:09:49.980 || generic silver round I think there
00:09:52.610 || 00:09:52.620 || definitely is a Advantage
00:09:56.350 || 00:09:56.360 || um as you mentioned uh the importance of
00:09:59.030 || 00:09:59.040 || recognizability and if if you are
00:10:00.530 || 00:10:00.540 || looking to prepare for a worst case
00:10:02.930 || 00:10:02.940 || scenario the more recognizable product
00:10:04.250 || 00:10:04.260 || the better
00:10:05.870 || 00:10:05.880 || um so definitely having a coin of the
00:10:07.970 || 00:10:07.980 || realm I think is very good would be very
00:10:10.009 || 00:10:10.019 || good in that uh kind of unprecedented
00:10:11.930 || 00:10:11.940 || situation there because you want the
00:10:14.030 || 00:10:14.040 || most recognized product
00:10:16.370 || 00:10:16.380 || um but if you're really just looking to
00:10:19.070 || 00:10:19.080 || have as much silver as possible then
00:10:20.990 || 00:10:21.000 || you'd probably want to go more with the
00:10:22.730 || 00:10:22.740 || generic rounds because those have a
00:10:25.670 || 00:10:25.680 || lower premium so as you get more and
00:10:27.290 || 00:10:27.300 || more functionality you're also paying
00:10:30.230 || 00:10:30.240 || that price of that higher premium but I
00:10:31.610 || 00:10:31.620 || don't know if you had any additional
00:10:33.610 || 00:10:33.620 || thoughts on that well I want to leverage
00:10:36.590 || 00:10:36.600 || uh again that idea maybe not all or
00:10:39.590 || 00:10:39.600 || nothing again in preparedness
00:10:41.090 || 00:10:41.100 || you know you don't necessarily just have
00:10:43.310 || 00:10:43.320 || one tool or whatever you try to have a
00:10:44.389 || 00:10:44.399 || variety of them and you try to have
00:10:46.190 || 00:10:46.200 || multiple in some cases that's the old
00:10:49.009 || 00:10:49.019 || rule that uh two is one and one is none
00:10:50.990 || 00:10:51.000 || so if you're building sort of this
00:10:54.050 || 00:10:54.060 || financial Fortress with bullion as part
00:10:57.170 || 00:10:57.180 || of your toolkit then having some
00:10:58.910 || 00:10:58.920 || constitutional coinage or junk silver
00:11:01.310 || 00:11:01.320 || like dimes and quarters then having some
00:11:04.310 || 00:11:04.320 || uh silver or gold coins from the your
00:11:06.410 || 00:11:06.420 || country so most of our viewers about 80
00:11:07.730 || 00:11:07.740 || of our viewers are from the United
00:11:10.610 || 00:11:10.620 || States about 10 from Canada and about 10
00:11:13.610 || 00:11:13.620 || from all other countries so wherever you
00:11:16.130 || 00:11:16.140 || live if you have coins that were made by
00:11:18.110 || 00:11:18.120 || the government of your country
00:11:20.569 || 00:11:20.579 || the chances are as you mentioned Elijah
00:11:22.130 || 00:11:22.140 || from a recognizability standpoint
00:11:23.930 || 00:11:23.940 || they're going to be trusted by most of
00:11:25.730 || 00:11:25.740 || the people you're going to be most
00:11:28.250 || 00:11:28.260 || likely to be trading with or needing to
00:11:30.829 || 00:11:30.839 || interact with uh going forward whatever
00:11:33.650 || 00:11:33.660 || scenario May unfold so it's just prudent
00:11:35.630 || 00:11:35.640 || to have some of that so put some of that
00:11:37.250 || 00:11:37.260 || right into your plan
00:11:38.870 || 00:11:38.880 || put it in but you don't have to have
00:11:42.110 || 00:11:42.120 || your entire stockpile be of that because
00:11:43.730 || 00:11:43.740 || it may be more expensive in the US it
00:11:45.170 || 00:11:45.180 || definitely is more expensive especially
00:11:46.210 || 00:11:46.220 || for the last two and a half years
00:11:48.350 || 00:11:48.360 || premiums have just gone completely
00:11:50.389 || 00:11:50.399 || separate for the U.S mint rather than
00:11:52.670 || 00:11:52.680 || from all other mints and it's we can
00:11:54.410 || 00:11:54.420 || talk about the reasons but just to get
00:11:57.170 || 00:11:57.180 || to get in on the point it's good to have
00:11:59.210 || 00:11:59.220 || some of those most useful small sizes
00:12:02.449 || 00:12:02.459 || some of the local government coins that
00:12:03.889 || 00:12:03.899 || you have and then if you want to add
00:12:05.509 || 00:12:05.519 || more ounces certainly you can add those
00:12:09.170 || 00:12:09.180 || at a lower cost way such as clients from
00:12:11.389 || 00:12:11.399 || other countries or bars or rounds from
00:12:14.090 || 00:12:14.100 || private mints but that's what I would
00:12:16.730 || 00:12:16.740 || suggest people consider is not a either
00:12:19.430 || 00:12:19.440 || or but a layered approach where you make
00:12:20.810 || 00:12:20.820 || sure you have at least some of what's
00:12:23.090 || 00:12:23.100 || going to be the most recognized and then
00:12:24.769 || 00:12:24.779 || in the United States that would be the
00:12:26.269 || 00:12:26.279 || American Silver Eagle the American Gold
00:12:27.710 || 00:12:27.720 || Eagle for example you should have at
00:12:30.170 || 00:12:30.180 || least some of those because the old rule
00:12:32.690 || 00:12:32.700 || of preparedness is that if you don't
00:12:35.269 || 00:12:35.279 || have what the other person trusts you
00:12:37.069 || 00:12:37.079 || don't have anything and you don't want
00:12:38.650 || 00:12:38.660 || to be be in a situation where it's
00:12:42.170 || 00:12:42.180 || stressful emergency urgent pressing all
00:12:43.550 || 00:12:43.560 || or nothing you got to get some supplies
00:12:44.690 || 00:12:44.700 || that you vitally need for your family
00:12:46.310 || 00:12:46.320 || whether it's medicine or food or fuel or
00:12:48.410 || 00:12:48.420 || whatever and the other person just says
00:12:50.090 || 00:12:50.100 || no I don't trust what you have there so
00:12:51.650 || 00:12:51.660 || I don't want to trade with you you don't
00:12:53.030 || 00:12:53.040 || want to be in that situation you want to
00:12:55.129 || 00:12:55.139 || make sure that if it comes to that you
00:12:56.509 || 00:12:56.519 || have what the other person trusts and
00:12:57.949 || 00:12:57.959 || you can you can proceed with your trade
00:13:00.230 || 00:13:00.240 || but if you're looking for gains or
00:13:02.090 || 00:13:02.100 || growth or protecting your purchasing
00:13:03.829 || 00:13:03.839 || power into the future outside the
00:13:06.050 || 00:13:06.060 || banking system right then it's the the
00:13:07.970 || 00:13:07.980 || number of ounces of gold or silver that
00:13:09.590 || 00:13:09.600 || you have and the way to get that
00:13:11.750 || 00:13:11.760 || may not and in the current environment
00:13:14.329 || 00:13:14.339 || certainly is not only through the U.S
00:13:15.410 || 00:13:15.420 || mint
00:13:17.509 || 00:13:17.519 || um but there's there's a wide variety of
00:13:18.889 || 00:13:18.899 || opinions about that and the other one
00:13:20.449 || 00:13:20.459 || that people always will bring up is
00:13:22.009 || 00:13:22.019 || either the word nationalization or
00:13:23.990 || 00:13:24.000 || confiscation we've interviewed Bill
00:13:25.610 || 00:13:25.620 || Holter several times on our Channel
00:13:28.069 || 00:13:28.079 || about this point in particular he is
00:13:30.470 || 00:13:30.480 || convinced personally and he says he's
00:13:32.150 || 00:13:32.160 || seen documents that seem to corroborate
00:13:34.970 || 00:13:34.980 || this that you will have lower risk of
00:13:37.190 || 00:13:37.200 || government nationalization of some of
00:13:39.410 || 00:13:39.420 || your products if they are directly from
00:13:40.910 || 00:13:40.920 || the U.S mint
00:13:43.610 || 00:13:43.620 || um I don't have those inside connections
00:13:47.030 || 00:13:47.040 || that he has but um we certainly respect
00:13:49.190 || 00:13:49.200 || people who want to minimize the chance
00:13:51.410 || 00:13:51.420 || of any any kind of loss of their assets
00:13:53.389 || 00:13:53.399 || by civil asset forfeiture any other
00:13:55.910 || 00:13:55.920 || method government confiscation so some
00:13:59.269 || 00:13:59.279 || people believe that by having the minted
00:14:00.710 || 00:14:00.720 || coins from your own country you'll
00:14:03.110 || 00:14:03.120 || reduce that risk I think that the jury
00:14:06.829 || 00:14:06.839 || is out on that so I would not uh try to
00:14:09.230 || 00:14:09.240 || convince someone of that myself and I
00:14:10.850 || 00:14:10.860 || think that it's it's prudent to have
00:14:13.129 || 00:14:13.139 || some of that but not necessarily have to
00:14:16.490 || 00:14:16.500 || pay up for all of your stack to be in
00:14:18.970 || 00:14:18.980 || your local uh government minted coins
00:14:21.889 || 00:14:21.899 || I've talked to about that very thing
00:14:23.990 || 00:14:24.000 || about kind of spreading out the premium
00:14:26.449 || 00:14:26.459 || with clients and it's really
00:14:28.430 || 00:14:28.440 || it opens their minds because you know if
00:14:29.870 || 00:14:29.880 || you if you're putting in for example
00:14:31.250 || 00:14:31.260 || let's say a hundred thousand dollars
00:14:34.250 || 00:14:34.260 || into precious metals and you put ten
00:14:35.569 || 00:14:35.579 || thousand dollars into the most
00:14:37.850 || 00:14:37.860 || recognized product for you know silver
00:14:40.730 || 00:14:40.740 || eagles and junk silver and you know at
00:14:42.410 || 00:14:42.420 || the height at the height of the premiums
00:14:43.790 || 00:14:43.800 || that we were seeing a couple months ago
00:14:46.430 || 00:14:46.440 || you're paying about 100 premium on the
00:14:49.129 || 00:14:49.139 || junks or on the Silver Eagles and the
00:14:52.069 || 00:14:52.079 || upwards of 50 premium above the spot
00:14:54.170 || 00:14:54.180 || price for the junk silver
00:14:56.389 || 00:14:56.399 || um so it seems like you know what what
00:14:58.550 || 00:14:58.560 || justifies that kind of premium and
00:15:00.350 || 00:15:00.360 || purchasing that product well you're
00:15:02.449 || 00:15:02.459 || purchasing it for insurance you know and
00:15:04.730 || 00:15:04.740 || even at that high premium if you put 10
00:15:07.310 || 00:15:07.320 || of your Holdings into that overall
00:15:09.470 || 00:15:09.480 || you're not actually paying that much a
00:15:11.389 || 00:15:11.399 || high of a premium so that's a really
00:15:14.030 || 00:15:14.040 || fantastic way to look at it and to have
00:15:15.949 || 00:15:15.959 || the maximum
00:15:18.290 || 00:15:18.300 || um maximum functionality but also
00:15:20.750 || 00:15:20.760 || overall not paying too much of a premium
00:15:21.650 || 00:15:21.660 || there
00:15:23.689 || 00:15:23.699 || um so we have another question here
00:15:25.610 || 00:15:25.620 || about what
00:15:26.210 || 00:15:26.220 || um
00:15:29.509 || 00:15:29.519 || when people sell back their bullion
00:15:32.030 || 00:15:32.040 || um what do we pay the most for over spot
00:15:33.710 || 00:15:33.720 || so we're actually we're running a
00:15:35.150 || 00:15:35.160 || special while back on Silver Eagles
00:15:37.850 || 00:15:37.860 || we're seeing a huge uh premium on
00:15:39.829 || 00:15:39.839 || BuyBacks for silver eagles that has come
00:15:42.410 || 00:15:42.420 || down uh since we ran that but
00:15:44.689 || 00:15:44.699 || um it really is just the same as you
00:15:46.910 || 00:15:46.920 || know when you're purchasing it it's
00:15:49.250 || 00:15:49.260 || pretty much the same sort of
00:15:52.129 || 00:15:52.139 || um levels right so you're looking at
00:15:53.509 || 00:15:53.519 || um the silver eagle being the most
00:15:55.790 || 00:15:55.800 || desirable product typically and that's
00:15:57.230 || 00:15:57.240 || going to be the highest buyback price
00:15:59.750 || 00:15:59.760 || then junk silver is pretty high in The
00:16:01.310 || 00:16:01.320 || Sovereign minted coins and then after
00:16:02.509 || 00:16:02.519 || that
00:16:05.269 || 00:16:05.279 || um the rounds the smaller bars and then
00:16:08.269 || 00:16:08.279 || the larger bars so to make it simple
00:16:11.090 || 00:16:11.100 || government minted products Us in
00:16:12.650 || 00:16:12.660 || particular is going to have the highest
00:16:15.829 || 00:16:15.839 || premium and then if it's a smaller
00:16:17.530 || 00:16:17.540 || product it's going to have a higher
00:16:20.210 || 00:16:20.220 || buyback price if it's a larger product
00:16:22.009 || 00:16:22.019 || privately minted it's going to have the
00:16:23.930 || 00:16:23.940 || lowest buyback price so that kind of
00:16:25.250 || 00:16:25.260 || covers that but I don't know if you had
00:16:27.230 || 00:16:27.240 || anything else to yeah I think you're
00:16:28.790 || 00:16:28.800 || right that's a simple rule of thumb is
00:16:30.350 || 00:16:30.360 || just whatever things are most expensive
00:16:31.550 || 00:16:31.560 || when you buy them are going to be the
00:16:32.750 || 00:16:32.760 || most expensive when you sell them back
00:16:34.730 || 00:16:34.740 || and that's a good thing but if people
00:16:37.310 || 00:16:37.320 || are really planning a strategy that they
00:16:38.870 || 00:16:38.880 || have a very high probability they say
00:16:41.030 || 00:16:41.040 || within three months six months a year
00:16:42.710 || 00:16:42.720 || two years we're going to be like we just
00:16:44.509 || 00:16:44.519 || sold our house we're going to be moving
00:16:45.829 || 00:16:45.839 || we're in apartment we don't want to have
00:16:47.810 || 00:16:47.820 || a stack of money so we're we're we're
00:16:51.230 || 00:16:51.240 || we're uh we want to buy some put that
00:16:54.050 || 00:16:54.060 || money into a medals and we know we're
00:16:55.249 || 00:16:55.259 || going to want to get that money back out
00:16:57.350 || 00:16:57.360 || within say a year or two that sort of
00:16:59.749 || 00:16:59.759 || thing then we really look for the
00:17:01.550 || 00:17:01.560 || round-trip premium difference and you
00:17:03.470 || 00:17:03.480 || will find that this the least friction
00:17:06.289 || 00:17:06.299 || the least uh premium loss tends to
00:17:08.449 || 00:17:08.459 || happen on those lower premium products
00:17:10.370 || 00:17:10.380 || so if you know for sure that you're
00:17:11.750 || 00:17:11.760 || going to want you're putting cash into
00:17:13.010 || 00:17:13.020 || metals and you want to get it back out
00:17:15.289 || 00:17:15.299 || say within a couple of years uh it's
00:17:17.929 || 00:17:17.939 || you'll you'll lose Less on the premium
00:17:20.210 || 00:17:20.220 || spread on Lower premium products than
00:17:22.130 || 00:17:22.140 || you will on high premium products but if
00:17:23.409 || 00:17:23.419 || you're just trying to make that decision
00:17:26.809 || 00:17:26.819 || about government minted versus bars that
00:17:29.570 || 00:17:29.580 || sort of thing uh be rest assured that
00:17:32.750 || 00:17:32.760 || when you do pay the highest premium to
00:17:35.450 || 00:17:35.460 || get in that's likely to to be the
00:17:37.010 || 00:17:37.020 || highest premium when you go to sell now
00:17:38.270 || 00:17:38.280 || that doesn't mean that premiums will be
00:17:40.250 || 00:17:40.260 || as high because premiums change all the
00:17:41.810 || 00:17:41.820 || time you're mentioning Elijah that we
00:17:43.490 || 00:17:43.500 || had this it was amazing we were buying
00:17:45.169 || 00:17:45.179 || back American silver eagles for over 11
00:17:48.289 || 00:17:48.299 || over spot but as recently as about a
00:17:50.450 || 00:17:50.460 || month and a half ago and that has really
00:17:52.310 || 00:17:52.320 || come down quite a bit in the last month
00:17:53.650 || 00:17:53.660 || and a half so
00:17:56.210 || 00:17:56.220 || that's what my point is is that the
00:17:58.610 || 00:17:58.620 || overall absolute premium scale is not
00:18:00.830 || 00:18:00.840 || guaranteed to stay the same but the
00:18:04.549 || 00:18:04.559 || relative uh strata within meaning a
00:18:06.289 || 00:18:06.299 || government-minted smaller sizes are
00:18:07.370 || 00:18:07.380 || going to always carry the highest
00:18:09.650 || 00:18:09.660 || premium even when you sell them back
00:18:11.090 || 00:18:11.100 || and if you see that question from Rick
00:18:13.310 || 00:18:13.320 || there from Frederick Newcombe says
00:18:14.510 || 00:18:14.520 || question lately we've been hearing more
00:18:16.370 || 00:18:16.380 || about Platinum becoming more desirable
00:18:18.770 || 00:18:18.780 || or discussed what's your take on the
00:18:21.110 || 00:18:21.120 || recent increased interest in Platinum
00:18:22.310 || 00:18:22.320 || products
00:18:24.590 || 00:18:24.600 || any thoughts from you Elijah on that
00:18:27.770 || 00:18:27.780 || yeah you know I I haven't seen you know
00:18:29.630 || 00:18:29.640 || in the last year or so like an increase
00:18:32.270 || 00:18:32.280 || of Interest I know the spot price did
00:18:35.330 || 00:18:35.340 || increase a bit it was below 900 and now
00:18:37.850 || 00:18:37.860 || it's around a thousand dollars right now
00:18:40.010 || 00:18:40.020 || um one of the main reasons people are
00:18:41.930 || 00:18:41.940 || buying Platinum right now and the
00:18:44.029 || 00:18:44.039 || bullish fundamentals behind it is that
00:18:45.830 || 00:18:45.840 || it's below gold's price it's about half
00:18:48.529 || 00:18:48.539 || gold's price and typically Platinum is
00:18:51.890 || 00:18:51.900 || higher than uh gold's price so it's very
00:18:55.430 || 00:18:55.440 || few uh it's very not frequent it's
00:18:58.010 || 00:18:58.020 || infrequent that we get a call for
00:18:59.029 || 00:18:59.039 || platinum
00:19:01.370 || 00:19:01.380 || um but you know that's the kind of the
00:19:03.049 || 00:19:03.059 || main reason that people are purchasing
00:19:05.270 || 00:19:05.280 || it and also it is an industrial metal
00:19:07.549 || 00:19:07.559 || and I think when it comes to investing
00:19:09.830 || 00:19:09.840 || in Platinum it's it there is a lot of
00:19:11.270 || 00:19:11.280 || Simplicity to it because it's not going
00:19:12.529 || 00:19:12.539 || to be something you're probably going to
00:19:14.150 || 00:19:14.160 || barter with in the future it's mainly
00:19:16.130 || 00:19:16.140 || speculating on the price
00:19:18.110 || 00:19:18.120 || um it does hold its value I mean it's a
00:19:20.450 || 00:19:20.460 || precious metal right so the likelihood
00:19:23.029 || 00:19:23.039 || of it's falling to zero is pretty much
00:19:25.190 || 00:19:25.200 || impossible right
00:19:28.010 || 00:19:28.020 || um but it's not a monetary medal so it's
00:19:29.810 || 00:19:29.820 || not something that really
00:19:32.390 || 00:19:32.400 || almost ever has been traded
00:19:33.350 || 00:19:33.360 || um so it's not something you're going to
00:19:34.549 || 00:19:34.559 || be partnering with it's not something
00:19:36.049 || 00:19:36.059 || you have to be too much concerned about
00:19:38.270 || 00:19:38.280 || do you want to borrow a coin just you
00:19:39.710 || 00:19:39.720 || know typically I would just go for the
00:19:41.570 || 00:19:41.580 || lowest premium product maybe the one
00:19:42.710 || 00:19:42.720 || ounce size gives you some some
00:19:44.810 || 00:19:44.820 || divisibility but you're not paying too
00:19:46.970 || 00:19:46.980 || high of a premium there and it's really
00:19:48.590 || 00:19:48.600 || just if you want to speculate on that
00:19:50.810 || 00:19:50.820 || price it's not so much of
00:19:53.810 || 00:19:53.820 || um you know a storage of value or you
00:19:55.370 || 00:19:55.380 || know holding it as insurance or anything
00:19:58.070 || 00:19:58.080 || like that yeah the the two stories that
00:19:59.930 || 00:19:59.940 || I've heard that draw people the most
00:20:01.730 || 00:20:01.740 || frequently to premium are twofold one
00:20:04.190 || 00:20:04.200 || you mentioned which was the unusually uh
00:20:06.049 || 00:20:06.059 || low price relative to Gold historically
00:20:07.370 || 00:20:07.380 || it trades higher than gold right now
00:20:09.049 || 00:20:09.059 || it's about a little bit more than half
00:20:10.970 || 00:20:10.980 || as much as gold so that's that's unusual
00:20:12.770 || 00:20:12.780 || some people go figure well something's
00:20:14.810 || 00:20:14.820 || that unusual it might represent an
00:20:16.130 || 00:20:16.140 || opportunity an Arbitrage opportunity
00:20:17.870 || 00:20:17.880 || against the future returning to the
00:20:20.390 || 00:20:20.400 || average the second is this story about
00:20:23.330 || 00:20:23.340 || industrial demand saying that because
00:20:26.029 || 00:20:26.039 || Platinum was more expensive than other
00:20:27.590 || 00:20:27.600 || Platinum Group Metals with similar
00:20:29.870 || 00:20:29.880 || properties such as Palladium a few years
00:20:32.150 || 00:20:32.160 || ago that the Auto industry and and the
00:20:34.070 || 00:20:34.080 || catalytic converter industry
00:20:36.409 || 00:20:36.419 || particularly changed the manufacturing
00:20:38.510 || 00:20:38.520 || design of catalytic converters to use
00:20:39.830 || 00:20:39.840 || Palladium which was
00:20:43.250 || 00:20:43.260 || that time now that relationship has
00:20:45.830 || 00:20:45.840 || inverted Palladium is multiple the time
00:20:48.230 || 00:20:48.240 || the the value or the cost excuse me of
00:20:52.010 || 00:20:52.020 || platinum and so there's there's uh talk
00:20:54.409 || 00:20:54.419 || that the industry always adapting to
00:20:56.750 || 00:20:56.760 || changing realities of you know component
00:20:58.850 || 00:20:58.860 || cost reduction Etc and that's part of my
00:21:01.490 || 00:21:01.500 || background in engineering is driving out
00:21:04.669 || 00:21:04.679 || of costs of manufacturing uh will uh
00:21:07.190 || 00:21:07.200 || predictably return to the lower cost
00:21:10.130 || 00:21:10.140 || raw material which is now Platinum so
00:21:11.750 || 00:21:11.760 || there's people who are banking on that
00:21:13.130 || 00:21:13.140 || thinking that if they invest in Platinum
00:21:16.130 || 00:21:16.140 || now that that will come back so because
00:21:18.830 || 00:21:18.840 || of that lower cost relative to Palladium
00:21:22.070 || 00:21:22.080 || so we'll see if that plays out or not
00:21:23.570 || 00:21:23.580 || um there's a point here made by Thomas
00:21:27.169 || 00:21:27.179 || toups who says uh clarifying that
00:21:29.330 || 00:21:29.340 || private minted rounds are just that
00:21:32.270 || 00:21:32.280 || round they're not legally coins so it's
00:21:34.610 || 00:21:34.620 || a good point he's right and Please be
00:21:37.070 || 00:21:37.080 || aware that that kind of bullion uh
00:21:39.110 || 00:21:39.120 || whether it's bars or rounds makes no
00:21:40.909 || 00:21:40.919 || difference it's rectangular or circular
00:21:42.289 || 00:21:42.299 || makes no difference it's treated as
00:21:46.430 || 00:21:46.440 || Boolean and in fact for example the IRS
00:21:47.770 || 00:21:47.780 || form
00:21:51.649 || 00:21:51.659 || 1099-b uh thresholds list that lists
00:21:53.690 || 00:21:53.700 || different categories of metals which if
00:21:55.730 || 00:21:55.740 || you sell them back to a dealer the
00:21:58.730 || 00:21:58.740 || dealer have certain mandated reporting
00:22:00.110 || 00:22:00.120 || thresholds which by the way if you're
00:22:01.490 || 00:22:01.500 || interested in that just make sure you
00:22:05.110 || 00:22:05.120 || email us at Liberty and finance at
00:22:07.850 || 00:22:07.860 || protonmail.com that's Liberty and
00:22:10.909 || 00:22:10.919 || finance at protonmail.com just put 1099
00:22:13.070 || 00:22:13.080 || as the title of the email to let us know
00:22:15.289 || 00:22:15.299 || your name in the email we'll send you a
00:22:17.149 || 00:22:17.159 || link to a document and that gives you
00:22:19.010 || 00:22:19.020 || that table of 1099v reportable
00:22:21.289 || 00:22:21.299 || thresholds but in that list it just says
00:22:24.529 || 00:22:24.539 || bars and the clarification is that bars
00:22:26.090 || 00:22:26.100 || and rounds are considered the same
00:22:28.190 || 00:22:28.200 || category from a government reporting
00:22:29.870 || 00:22:29.880 || standpoint they're just they're just
00:22:32.570 || 00:22:32.580 || straight up private bullion
00:22:34.310 || 00:22:34.320 || and we do have another question kind of
00:22:36.409 || 00:22:36.419 || uh you know on the same topic of I guess
00:22:38.930 || 00:22:38.940 || bars here and it's on Thousand ounce
00:22:41.390 || 00:22:41.400 || bars there is a bit of talk in the chat
00:22:43.430 || 00:22:43.440 || here about thousand ounce bars and I
00:22:44.930 || 00:22:44.940 || think it gets back to what we were
00:22:47.990 || 00:22:48.000 || talking about earlier is uh the premiums
00:22:49.669 || 00:22:49.679 || right you're going to have if it's a
00:22:50.870 || 00:22:50.880 || larger product you're going to have a
00:22:53.210 || 00:22:53.220 || lower premium and typically what I've
00:22:55.430 || 00:22:55.440 || found and we've both found this is that
00:22:58.610 || 00:22:58.620 || if you're paying a higher premium the
00:23:01.070 || 00:23:01.080 || difference between the purchase price in
00:23:04.010 || 00:23:04.020 || the buyback price is going to be a bit
00:23:05.750 || 00:23:05.760 || bigger so the margin is going to be a
00:23:07.610 || 00:23:07.620 || bit bigger so the spread in the premium
00:23:09.049 || 00:23:09.059 || spread right
00:23:11.930 || 00:23:11.940 || so if you're looking at investing a
00:23:14.570 || 00:23:14.580 || large sum of money I'd say we can't give
00:23:16.490 || 00:23:16.500 || invite individualized Financial advice
00:23:19.010 || 00:23:19.020 || but I think a principle will be
00:23:21.409 || 00:23:21.419 || considering is you want divisibility
00:23:23.930 || 00:23:23.940 || right so a thousand ounce bar if you
00:23:25.490 || 00:23:25.500 || have twenty five thousand dollars to
00:23:26.690 || 00:23:26.700 || invest you're only going to be able to
00:23:28.610 || 00:23:28.620 || purchase 1 000 ounce bar and when you go
00:23:29.690 || 00:23:29.700 || back to sell you're going to have to
00:23:31.430 || 00:23:31.440 || sell everything at once
00:23:34.190 || 00:23:34.200 || um so you know if you're looking to you
00:23:35.750 || 00:23:35.760 || know invest a quarter million dollars
00:23:37.130 || 00:23:37.140 || then maybe that's kind of the point
00:23:38.750 || 00:23:38.760 || where like oh maybe I should go the
00:23:41.630 || 00:23:41.640 || Thousand ounce bar uh route instead of
00:23:43.430 || 00:23:43.440 || you know maybe smaller bars than that
00:23:44.690 || 00:23:44.700 || because you know the margins are going
00:23:45.890 || 00:23:45.900 || to be smaller you're going to be paying
00:23:46.970 || 00:23:46.980 || a lower premium you're going to be
00:23:49.250 || 00:23:49.260 || getting more silver so that might be the
00:23:51.350 || 00:23:51.360 || point where you might be looking at uh
00:23:52.970 || 00:23:52.980 || the Thousand ounce bars but probably
00:23:55.610 || 00:23:55.620 || anything you know uh if you're looking
00:23:57.230 || 00:23:57.240 || again you know twenty five fifty
00:23:59.390 || 00:23:59.400 || thousand dollars it's gonna you're gonna
00:24:01.490 || 00:24:01.500 || sacrifice a lot of divisibility if you
00:24:03.590 || 00:24:03.600 || go that route and kind of again talking
00:24:05.390 || 00:24:05.400 || of about what we were talking about
00:24:08.510 || 00:24:08.520 || before is why are you investing if you
00:24:10.490 || 00:24:10.500 || want that addition National Protection
00:24:12.770 || 00:24:12.780 || of the most recognized product make sure
00:24:14.810 || 00:24:14.820 || to also get that as well like the silver
00:24:17.029 || 00:24:17.039 || eagles and junk silver but did you have
00:24:18.830 || 00:24:18.840 || any other um thoughts on Thousand ounce
00:24:21.950 || 00:24:21.960 || bars and what are the
00:24:25.070 || 00:24:25.080 || purposes for clients that you've seen
00:24:27.529 || 00:24:27.539 || for clients to purchase them yep there's
00:24:29.149 || 00:24:29.159 || there's people for whom it would be
00:24:30.590 || 00:24:30.600 || absolutely the wrong thing and there's
00:24:31.909 || 00:24:31.919 || people for who it is absolutely the
00:24:32.990 || 00:24:33.000 || right thing
00:24:36.529 || 00:24:36.539 || um so again back to that uh that
00:24:39.130 || 00:24:39.140 || discussion about being able to have
00:24:42.350 || 00:24:42.360 || flexibility in your in your actions as
00:24:44.810 || 00:24:44.820 || life unfolds and the unknown becomes
00:24:46.789 || 00:24:46.799 || known as we move forward in this strange
00:24:50.450 || 00:24:50.460 || world who knows when you might need to
00:24:52.909 || 00:24:52.919 || tap some of your medals for Value it may
00:24:54.770 || 00:24:54.780 || be an opportunity there might be some
00:24:56.270 || 00:24:56.280 || land that becomes available for purchase
00:24:58.070 || 00:24:58.080 || or it might be a business opportunity or
00:25:01.250 || 00:25:01.260 || maybe an emergency need that comes up or
00:25:03.049 || 00:25:03.059 || something where you need to liquidate or
00:25:06.350 || 00:25:06.360 || want to liquidate whatever that is you
00:25:08.090 || 00:25:08.100 || don't want to have your hands tied to
00:25:09.710 || 00:25:09.720 || where you have to do it all or nothing
00:25:11.450 || 00:25:11.460 || type decision I mean who would like that
00:25:12.590 || 00:25:12.600 || in any part of their life where it's
00:25:14.690 || 00:25:14.700 || always All or Nothing is something you'd
00:25:16.850 || 00:25:16.860 || like to avoid it comes back to a similar
00:25:18.470 || 00:25:18.480 || question when people ask us when they
00:25:20.210 || 00:25:20.220 || call us and they say well I'm kind of
00:25:21.770 || 00:25:21.780 || behind I'm just getting started should I
00:25:23.510 || 00:25:23.520 || go all in right off the bat or should I
00:25:25.370 || 00:25:25.380 || dollar cost average in you know monthly
00:25:27.470 || 00:25:27.480 || or something there's no one right answer
00:25:30.110 || 00:25:30.120 || to that question but for those who do
00:25:33.470 || 00:25:33.480 || find sort of a peace of mind and kind of
00:25:36.409 || 00:25:36.419 || a being allowing you to be more more
00:25:40.070 || 00:25:40.080 || deliberate more methodical more measured
00:25:42.169 || 00:25:42.179 || in your choices it's nice to be able to
00:25:44.210 || 00:25:44.220 || if you're buying dollar cost average in
00:25:46.130 || 00:25:46.140 || if you're selling to dollar cost average
00:25:48.950 || 00:25:48.960 || out and if you if you think about that
00:25:51.470 || 00:25:51.480 || in terms of at least like say three or
00:25:54.909 || 00:25:54.919 || four or five or ten or Twenty uh sub
00:25:58.750 || 00:25:58.760 || portions of your overall strategic move
00:26:01.669 || 00:26:01.679 || uh then that might help answer your
00:26:03.830 || 00:26:03.840 || question of whether what size products
00:26:05.029 || 00:26:05.039 || are the right for you on the on the big
00:26:06.529 || 00:26:06.539 || side it's not just thousand knots bars
00:26:08.930 || 00:26:08.940 || even 100 ounce bars or kilo bars can
00:26:11.149 || 00:26:11.159 || affect your your flexibility and your
00:26:13.190 || 00:26:13.200 || optionality when you're cost averaging
00:26:15.470 || 00:26:15.480 || in or cost averaging out or when you
00:26:17.269 || 00:26:17.279 || want that ability I don't think anybody
00:26:20.690 || 00:26:20.700 || would feel constrained if you had to if
00:26:22.430 || 00:26:22.440 || you had 20 of a certain thing and you
00:26:23.930 || 00:26:23.940 || decide I think I want to sell a little
00:26:25.909 || 00:26:25.919 || bit and you sell 120th of your total
00:26:28.370 || 00:26:28.380 || stash that doesn't seem so restrictive
00:26:29.990 || 00:26:30.000 || on you but if you suddenly realize I
00:26:31.970 || 00:26:31.980 || only have two I only have three because
00:26:34.010 || 00:26:34.020 || that was my whole nest egg and then you
00:26:35.690 || 00:26:35.700 || have to sell half or a third of your
00:26:39.230 || 00:26:39.240 || entire stack in a single thing because
00:26:41.510 || 00:26:41.520 || that was necessitated because you bought
00:26:43.909 || 00:26:43.919 || such big pieces that's unnecessarily
00:26:46.070 || 00:26:46.080 || restricting your future so people for
00:26:48.110 || 00:26:48.120 || whom it fits well are people who like
00:26:50.450 || 00:26:50.460 || come across an inheritance they sell a
00:26:52.070 || 00:26:52.080 || big business they sell a big piece of
00:26:53.810 || 00:26:53.820 || real estate or something like that they
00:26:55.370 || 00:26:55.380 || have a big Ira that they've amassed over
00:26:57.649 || 00:26:57.659 || their entire career and they want a very
00:26:59.029 || 00:26:59.039 || cost effective way and they're planning
00:27:01.130 || 00:27:01.140 || on storing an evolved not necessarily
00:27:03.710 || 00:27:03.720 || taking personal delivery then thousand
00:27:05.390 || 00:27:05.400 || dollars bars are a good fit for that
00:27:07.430 || 00:27:07.440 || perhaps I mean if you have if you have
00:27:09.590 || 00:27:09.600 || you know 300 or 400 000 worth to put
00:27:11.029 || 00:27:11.039 || into silver then twenty thousand dollar
00:27:14.090 || 00:27:14.100 || pieces don't sound so bad but if you're
00:27:15.470 || 00:27:15.480 || sitting there at home and you have this
00:27:17.390 || 00:27:17.400 || thing delivered and it weighs 70 pounds
00:27:19.310 || 00:27:19.320 || and you think gee now what am I going to
00:27:20.510 || 00:27:20.520 || do with it because this can be really
00:27:22.490 || 00:27:22.500 || you know difficult or expensive or maybe
00:27:24.409 || 00:27:24.419 || not even possible to ensure if I want to
00:27:26.630 || 00:27:26.640 || ship it in the future for you know to
00:27:27.710 || 00:27:27.720 || some other location or something
00:27:29.570 || 00:27:29.580 || something to think about
00:27:31.310 || 00:27:31.320 || um so the answer to that question
00:27:32.750 || 00:27:32.760 || depends on
00:27:35.149 || 00:27:35.159 || what your overall
00:27:37.130 || 00:27:37.140 || size of your nest egg is and what
00:27:39.830 || 00:27:39.840 || percentage of this this will represent
00:27:41.690 || 00:27:41.700 || and that will affect your optionality
00:27:43.130 || 00:27:43.140 || going forward but it is the least
00:27:46.070 || 00:27:46.080 || expensive to get in and get out of
00:27:47.510 || 00:27:47.520 || all right well I think that's all we
00:27:50.029 || 00:27:50.039 || have time for tonight but thank you for
00:27:52.070 || 00:27:52.080 || everyone watching um for making this
00:27:53.630 || 00:27:53.640 || possible you know for joining us here
00:27:56.269 || 00:27:56.279 || and asking the questions we couldn't do
00:27:58.669 || 00:27:58.679 || this without you and I guess just to
00:28:00.890 || 00:28:00.900 || reiterate you know it's really important
00:28:02.810 || 00:28:02.820 || to kind of step back and realize you
00:28:05.090 || 00:28:05.100 || know why invest in Precious Metals in
00:28:06.950 || 00:28:06.960 || the first place it's taking back your
00:28:08.570 || 00:28:08.580 || personal sovereignty it's becoming your
00:28:10.730 || 00:28:10.740 || own Central Bank as Gregory manorino
00:28:12.289 || 00:28:12.299 || likes to say
00:28:13.730 || 00:28:13.740 || um you know you're holding something of
00:28:16.310 || 00:28:16.320 || real value it's insurance for a worst
00:28:18.710 || 00:28:18.720 || case scenario and if you just remember
00:28:22.310 || 00:28:22.320 || that in mind and again just why are you
00:28:24.590 || 00:28:24.600 || purchasing it everything else kind of
00:28:26.090 || 00:28:26.100 || comes naturally and we can definitely
00:28:28.730 || 00:28:28.740 || walk you through the process and you
00:28:31.430 || 00:28:31.440 || know figure out what's gonna help you
00:28:32.750 || 00:28:32.760 || figure out right what's going to
00:28:35.750 || 00:28:35.760 || probably be the best uh kind of product
00:28:38.450 || 00:28:38.460 || so thank you so much for watching um and
00:28:40.010 || 00:28:40.020 || I guess then again any last thoughts
00:28:41.990 || 00:28:42.000 || before before we leave our viewers here
00:28:43.250 || 00:28:43.260 || well I think you just touched on
00:28:44.690 || 00:28:44.700 || something there just to remind everyone
00:28:47.149 || 00:28:47.159 || that if you are whether you're just
00:28:49.669 || 00:28:49.679 || getting started or whether you're trying
00:28:51.590 || 00:28:51.600 || to help a family member or relative
00:28:53.570 || 00:28:53.580 || who's just getting started and you want
00:28:55.549 || 00:28:55.559 || to make sure that there is a
00:28:57.710 || 00:28:57.720 || consultative approach where their
00:29:00.169 || 00:29:00.179 || comfort zone their specific individual
00:29:02.149 || 00:29:02.159 || needs are taken into account and not
00:29:03.649 || 00:29:03.659 || just a cookie cutter approach or not
00:29:04.850 || 00:29:04.860 || just left completely unto yourself
00:29:06.529 || 00:29:06.539 || that's what one of the differences
00:29:08.750 || 00:29:08.760 || between working with us and with Miles
00:29:11.570 || 00:29:11.580 || Franklin versus just going to an online
00:29:13.610 || 00:29:13.620 || dealer you know anybody can go to an
00:29:15.649 || 00:29:15.659 || online dealer and click a few clicks and
00:29:16.970 || 00:29:16.980 || put some things in a shopping cart and
00:29:19.610 || 00:29:19.620 || check out the question is was it the
00:29:21.049 || 00:29:21.059 || right fit for you did it help you to
00:29:22.669 || 00:29:22.679 || accomplish what you were really needing
00:29:24.289 || 00:29:24.299 || to so that you can be successful going
00:29:26.510 || 00:29:26.520 || forward our whole mission here at

00:29:33.230 || 00:29:33.240 || your financial preparedness so we're not
00:29:35.330 || 00:29:35.340 || financial advisors but we can help at

00:29:40.190 || 00:29:40.200 || questions and share information we've
00:29:41.750 || 00:29:41.760 || gotten from interviewing lots of expert
00:29:44.450 || 00:29:44.460 || guests on this channel and that we keep
00:29:46.130 || 00:29:46.140 || getting told by people every week that
00:29:47.570 || 00:29:47.580 || that was actually very helpful to them
00:29:49.430 || 00:29:49.440 || and something they couldn't get anywhere
00:29:51.649 || 00:29:51.659 || else so happy to help people do that and

00:29:57.350 || 00:29:57.360 || very different from say going to like
00:30:00.649 || 00:30:00.659 || the really big fancy department store in
00:30:02.750 || 00:30:02.760 || their fancy uh getting fitted for some
00:30:04.070 || 00:30:04.080 || you know custom tailored suit or
00:30:04.909 || 00:30:04.919 || something and then you're paying
00:30:06.289 || 00:30:06.299 || multiple multiple times what you'd be
00:30:07.990 || 00:30:08.000 || paying if you got it at the cheap place
00:30:11.149 || 00:30:11.159 || we are an unusual combination of that
