00:00:02.030 || 00:00:02.040 || once these kinds of stones start rolling
00:00:03.830 || 00:00:03.840 || downhill they pick up other Stones until
00:00:04.850 || 00:00:04.860 || they get to the base of the mountain
00:00:06.710 || 00:00:06.720 || there's not going to be a lender of Last

00:01:43.969 || 00:01:43.979 || another conversation with you always
00:01:45.770 || 00:01:45.780 || have a good time and looking forward to
00:01:48.830 || 00:01:48.840 || starting 2023 on the right foot first if
00:01:50.870 || 00:01:50.880 || we can discuss the FTX Scandal I know we
00:01:52.550 || 00:01:52.560 || touched on this last time and you had
00:01:55.249 || 00:01:55.259 || said that the the contagion that would
00:01:57.410 || 00:01:57.420 || flow from that would really
00:01:59.030 || 00:01:59.040 || um have a huge impact on the
00:02:01.490 || 00:02:01.500 || cryptocurrency sphere we've seen that a
00:02:03.710 || 00:02:03.720 || lot of the cryptocurrencies still are
00:02:06.410 || 00:02:06.420 || quite below uh the levels they were
00:02:09.650 || 00:02:09.660 || before uh that Scandal broke and you
00:02:12.650 || 00:02:12.660 || know a lot of the uh prosecution that's
00:02:14.630 || 00:02:14.640 || been going on people are saying you know
00:02:16.729 || 00:02:16.739 || is is not enough what is your
00:02:19.390 || 00:02:19.400 || perspective active as we've really seen
00:02:22.790 || 00:02:22.800 || this Scandal unfold
00:02:24.410 || 00:02:24.420 || it's unfolding pretty much as we
00:02:26.930 || 00:02:26.940 || predicted last time we connected since
00:02:28.790 || 00:02:28.800 || we last talked obviously Sam bankman
00:02:30.589 || 00:02:30.599 || freed has been arrested and we've
00:02:34.010 || 00:02:34.020 || learned that his former CEO of aluminum
00:02:37.130 || 00:02:37.140 || research Caroline Ellison I believe was
00:02:39.890 || 00:02:39.900 || uh was testifying against Sam
00:02:42.430 || 00:02:42.440 || bankmanfried and providing key evidence
00:02:45.470 || 00:02:45.480 || with another partner from the Alameda
00:02:46.190 || 00:02:46.200 || team
00:02:48.350 || 00:02:48.360 || and I do think that the contagion just
00:02:50.330 || 00:02:50.340 || this weekend I suspect that we're going
00:02:54.430 || 00:02:54.440 || to see a resolution to the um the dcg
00:02:56.869 || 00:02:56.879 || Genesis situation it looks like genesis
00:02:58.729 || 00:02:58.739 || might be on the verge of filing for
00:03:00.770 || 00:03:00.780 || bankruptcy according to reports and um
00:03:02.449 || 00:03:02.459 || there's all kinds of intrigue in the
00:03:03.890 || 00:03:03.900 || crypto world but this would be the next
00:03:05.570 || 00:03:05.580 || Domino to fall for those that aren't
00:03:07.910 || 00:03:07.920 || aware uh the Bingo floss twins have
00:03:09.410 || 00:03:09.420 || several hundred million dollars of
00:03:12.350 || 00:03:12.360 || client funds locked up in in Genesis
00:03:14.449 || 00:03:14.459 || which is run by the dcg group which also
00:03:17.449 || 00:03:17.459 || owns the grayscale Bitcoin trust and so
00:03:18.649 || 00:03:18.659 || we're seeing an enormous amount of
00:03:20.809 || 00:03:20.819 || contagion play out these things take
00:03:22.309 || 00:03:22.319 || time of course
00:03:23.930 || 00:03:23.940 || um bankruptcy petitions take time to
00:03:26.149 || 00:03:26.159 || write and file it and once the lawyers
00:03:27.470 || 00:03:27.480 || get involved and The Regulators get
00:03:29.509 || 00:03:29.519 || involved but I think after that if that
00:03:30.890 || 00:03:30.900 || does happen and I'm not saying it will
00:03:32.570 || 00:03:32.580 || but that certainly seems to be the next
00:03:34.850 || 00:03:34.860 || Domino to fall in in the great crypto
00:03:37.070 || 00:03:37.080 || contagion of 2223
00:03:38.449 || 00:03:38.459 || um the next one after that would
00:03:41.089 || 00:03:41.099 || probably be binance that's the big
00:03:43.970 || 00:03:43.980 || um offshore unregulated crypto exchange
00:03:46.130 || 00:03:46.140 || between them and bitfinex the last two
00:03:47.630 || 00:03:47.640 || big ones remaining and then the big
00:03:49.970 || 00:03:49.980 || Domino the last Domino and the one that
00:03:51.589 || 00:03:51.599 || we think is Central to all of the fraud
00:03:52.850 || 00:03:52.860 || in the crypto universities of course
00:03:55.550 || 00:03:55.560 || tether the stable coin that is allegedly
00:03:58.309 || 00:03:58.319 || backed one-to-one with liquid US dollar
00:04:00.289 || 00:04:00.299 || or US dollar equivalence like short-term
00:04:01.309 || 00:04:01.319 || treasuries
00:04:03.170 || 00:04:03.180 || um we suspect that that once the full
00:04:06.050 || 00:04:06.060 || history of this period is written
00:04:08.449 || 00:04:08.459 || um it all sort of circles around tether
00:04:10.009 || 00:04:10.019 || which is ironic because tether's big
00:04:12.530 || 00:04:12.540 || competitor of course usdc is brought to
00:04:14.449 || 00:04:14.459 || the market by Circle so I think we're
00:04:15.710 || 00:04:15.720 || going to see the next leg this weekend
00:04:18.530 || 00:04:18.540 || or shortly thereafter what that means
00:04:20.569 || 00:04:20.579 || for the the grayscale Bitcoin trust is a
00:04:22.490 || 00:04:22.500 || whole other question but I think largely
00:04:24.170 || 00:04:24.180 || as we predict that things are rolling
00:04:26.090 || 00:04:26.100 || you know once once these kinds of stones
00:04:27.650 || 00:04:27.660 || start rolling downhill
00:04:29.450 || 00:04:29.460 || they pick up other Stones until they get
00:04:30.830 || 00:04:30.840 || to the base of the mountain
00:04:33.170 || 00:04:33.180 || for those who are holding cryptocurrency
00:04:34.430 || 00:04:34.440 || because I know you talked about it
00:04:36.290 || 00:04:36.300 || before how you know FTX is not the
00:04:38.330 || 00:04:38.340 || equivalent of Bitcoin
00:04:40.490 || 00:04:40.500 || um so is this bad news for the
00:04:43.370 || 00:04:43.380 || cryptocurrency sphere Bitcoin
00:04:45.469 || 00:04:45.479 || um can we can kind of be specific on
00:04:47.570 || 00:04:47.580 || what spheres is this going to impact and
00:04:49.490 || 00:04:49.500 || what spheres it's is this not going to
00:04:51.409 || 00:04:51.419 || impact a great question so if we
00:04:53.330 || 00:04:53.340 || separate Bitcoin from crypto
00:04:55.430 || 00:04:55.440 || the the only sort of overhangs for
00:04:58.310 || 00:04:58.320 || Bitcoin and I see are one how does the
00:05:01.129 || 00:05:01.139 || massive discount to nav that is
00:05:03.170 || 00:05:03.180 || currently supported by the grayscale
00:05:06.230 || 00:05:06.240 || Bitcoin trust um how's that resolved and
00:05:08.090 || 00:05:08.100 || the way in which that resolve could
00:05:09.950 || 00:05:09.960 || result in significant selling pressure
00:05:12.110 || 00:05:12.120 || on Bitcoin in the near term which you
00:05:13.909 || 00:05:13.919 || could either be a risk to your portfolio
00:05:15.950 || 00:05:15.960 || or a buying opportunity
00:05:17.570 || 00:05:17.580 || um the other big overhang is to what
00:05:19.670 || 00:05:19.680 || extent has the price of Bitcoin been
00:05:22.610 || 00:05:22.620 || manipulated by tether which if tether is
00:05:24.950 || 00:05:24.960 || in fact just counterfeited could provide
00:05:27.110 || 00:05:27.120 || an artificial bid under Bitcoin and so
00:05:29.029 || 00:05:29.039 || once those two things are resolved and
00:05:30.830 || 00:05:30.840 || we have a full washout of the crypto
00:05:33.050 || 00:05:33.060 || Universe then and only then will we get
00:05:34.790 || 00:05:34.800 || I believe an accurate price Discovery
00:05:36.170 || 00:05:36.180 || for Bitcoin which I would say is
00:05:38.629 || 00:05:38.639 || separate from the rest of crypto for
00:05:40.370 || 00:05:40.380 || reasons we I believe we got into last
00:05:43.189 || 00:05:43.199 || time but until we see a resolution it's
00:05:44.870 || 00:05:44.880 || impossible to say you know for example
00:05:46.310 || 00:05:46.320 || if
00:05:48.350 || 00:05:48.360 || um if Finance or business were to go
00:05:51.830 || 00:05:51.840 || under as exchanges you could see uh or
00:05:53.450 || 00:05:53.460 || if tether were to be rolled up you could
00:05:56.450 || 00:05:56.460 || see a rush of people trying to exchange
00:05:58.610 || 00:05:58.620 || their soon-to-be worthless tethers into
00:06:02.029 || 00:06:02.039 || Bitcoin and as Christ in tethers uh you
00:06:03.590 || 00:06:03.600 || could see the price of Bitcoin Skyrocket
00:06:06.050 || 00:06:06.060 || uh and so there's it's a very fluid
00:06:08.749 || 00:06:08.759 || chaotic situation because if the price
00:06:11.270 || 00:06:11.280 || of Bitcoin is indeed which is largely
00:06:12.710 || 00:06:12.720 || transacted back together you know people
00:06:14.570 || 00:06:14.580 || rush to get a tethering into a safe
00:06:16.249 || 00:06:16.259 || haven like Bitcoin at least
00:06:18.770 || 00:06:18.780 || comparatively on certain exchanges you
00:06:19.909 || 00:06:19.919 || could see the price of Bitcoin really
00:06:21.529 || 00:06:21.539 || explode so it's a very dangerous time to
00:06:23.390 || 00:06:23.400 || trade that's why we don't trade
00:06:25.309 || 00:06:25.319 || um but to the to the particular question
00:06:27.170 || 00:06:27.180 || and back to the first question the
00:06:29.570 || 00:06:29.580 || contagion has a lot more you know
00:06:31.430 || 00:06:31.440 || there's not going to be a lender of Last
00:06:32.570 || 00:06:32.580 || Resort because these are totally
00:06:35.090 || 00:06:35.100 || unregulated markets and so I don't see
00:06:38.029 || 00:06:38.039 || how you know uh Genesis survives I don't
00:06:39.590 || 00:06:39.600 || see how
00:06:42.230 || 00:06:42.240 || um how uh the grayscale Bitcoin trust
00:06:44.150 || 00:06:44.160 || can trade it a 40 to 50 discount to nav
00:06:45.890 || 00:06:45.900 || and definitely I don't see how by an
00:06:47.870 || 00:06:47.880 || answer bid for next who are pretty
00:06:49.249 || 00:06:49.259 || clearly laundering significant amounts
00:06:50.809 || 00:06:50.819 || of money I don't know how they can
00:06:52.249 || 00:06:52.259 || withstand this contagion for example
00:06:54.350 || 00:06:54.360 || sandbankment freed of course would
00:06:56.570 || 00:06:56.580 || probably look to cooperate for a lighter
00:06:58.370 || 00:06:58.380 || sentence himself he'd be a fool not to
00:06:59.930 || 00:06:59.940 || at this point if you ask me considering
00:07:01.670 || 00:07:01.680 || the amount of evidence that the people
00:07:03.409 || 00:07:03.419 || that are testifying against him have all
00:07:05.990 || 00:07:06.000 || reproduced and then that leads up the
00:07:07.430 || 00:07:07.440 || next leg at the ladder and up the next
00:07:09.529 || 00:07:09.539 || leg of ladder and all the latter ends
00:07:11.689 || 00:07:11.699 || the last rung of the ladder is is with
00:07:14.930 || 00:07:14.940 || tether and so um if we are no coiners we
00:07:16.730 || 00:07:16.740 || have no Bitcoin we have no ether we have
00:07:18.170 || 00:07:18.180 || no crypto certainly never would own any
00:07:21.230 || 00:07:21.240 || crypto but if we were thinking about
00:07:23.390 || 00:07:23.400 || um getting say a small allocation to a
00:07:25.070 || 00:07:25.080 || Bitcoin we wouldn't we wouldn't go near
00:07:27.170 || 00:07:27.180 || it until all of this is resolved so even
00:07:30.770 || 00:07:30.780 || holding cryptocurrency or Bitcoin
00:07:32.210 || 00:07:32.220 || um outside of the system for example
00:07:34.610 || 00:07:34.620 || like on a jump drive you wouldn't touch
00:07:36.409 || 00:07:36.419 || it right now given a everything that's
00:07:38.510 || 00:07:38.520 || going on well it's the price that you're
00:07:40.610 || 00:07:40.620 || paying to get it right and so
00:07:42.710 || 00:07:42.720 || um I have no idea how the price of
00:07:44.089 || 00:07:44.099 || Bitcoin is going to react to the full
00:07:46.790 || 00:07:46.800 || flush of the crypto community
00:07:48.710 || 00:07:48.720 || um as I said it could go either way it
00:07:51.529 || 00:07:51.539 || could you know be unlocking of the the
00:07:53.330 || 00:07:53.340 || massive amount of Bitcoin that grayscale
00:07:54.830 || 00:07:54.840 || owns and the liquidation of that to
00:07:57.050 || 00:07:57.060 || satisfy creditors could drive the price
00:07:59.270 || 00:07:59.280 || of Bitcoin to price levels that were
00:08:00.770 || 00:08:00.780 || even lower than before covet on the flip
00:08:03.529 || 00:08:03.539 || side in the days before a
00:08:04.909 || 00:08:04.919 || um a full tether unwind you might see
00:08:06.350 || 00:08:06.360 || the price of Bitcoin explode if I don't
00:08:08.450 || 00:08:08.460 || have an edge and I don't have a passion
00:08:10.670 || 00:08:10.680 || about owning an asset I'm not sure why I
00:08:11.990 || 00:08:12.000 || would stick my hand in the blender here
00:08:13.249 || 00:08:13.259 || and hope I don't get caught you know
00:08:14.930 || 00:08:14.940 || it's um but that's just me that's
00:08:16.430 || 00:08:16.440 || everybody's investment Horizons are
00:08:17.689 || 00:08:17.699 || different and that's just our view of
00:08:19.790 || 00:08:19.800 || the situation today and I know we've
00:08:22.969 || 00:08:22.979 || also seen the doj you just reported on
00:08:23.869 || 00:08:23.879 || this
00:08:25.790 || 00:08:25.800 || um really moving to prosecute Executives
00:08:26.869 || 00:08:26.879 || here
00:08:28.730 || 00:08:28.740 || um what is your perspective on that and
00:08:30.589 || 00:08:30.599 || how it's already played out
00:08:32.810 || 00:08:32.820 || yeah we put out a piece this morning um
00:08:35.050 || 00:08:35.060 || called unnatural immunity
00:08:38.029 || 00:08:38.039 || which highlights a shift in the doj's
00:08:39.949 || 00:08:39.959 || approach and emphasis that I think many
00:08:41.510 || 00:08:41.520 || have overlooked they put out a pretty
00:08:43.670 || 00:08:43.680 || important memo a couple of months ago a
00:08:46.070 || 00:08:46.080 || 15-page memo detailing their desire to
00:08:47.870 || 00:08:47.880 || shift away from holding corporations
00:08:49.550 || 00:08:49.560 || responsible for crimes to holding
00:08:51.250 || 00:08:51.260 || individuals within those corporations
00:08:54.110 || 00:08:54.120 || especially the executives uh who order
00:08:55.910 || 00:08:55.920 || the people to commit the crimes in the
00:08:58.370 || 00:08:58.380 || first place and we're we're we believe
00:09:00.470 || 00:09:00.480 || we're going to see as this potential
00:09:02.389 || 00:09:02.399 || bear Market plays out and the the Golden
00:09:04.610 || 00:09:04.620 || Age of fraud as Jim chanos calls it um
00:09:06.829 || 00:09:06.839 || that wave hits the shore and we find out
00:09:08.570 || 00:09:08.580 || which companies are actually fraudulent
00:09:10.190 || 00:09:10.200 || and maybe you know fabricating their
00:09:11.930 || 00:09:11.940 || financials and so on
00:09:13.970 || 00:09:13.980 || um we you know we pointed out in the
00:09:15.949 || 00:09:15.959 || piece of the conviction of Trevor Milton
00:09:18.530 || 00:09:18.540 || and Elizabeth Holmes uh Mark's you know
00:09:19.970 || 00:09:19.980 || a focus on the people are not
00:09:20.870 || 00:09:20.880 || necessarily the company you know
00:09:22.430 || 00:09:22.440 || Nicholas settled and Nicola as a
00:09:23.810 || 00:09:23.820 || business still exists but Trevor Belton
00:09:25.670 || 00:09:25.680 || is facing prison time and if that
00:09:28.310 || 00:09:28.320 || becomes a trend we're going to see that
00:09:31.250 || 00:09:31.260 || as crypto explodes as well um and the
00:09:33.829 || 00:09:33.839 || headline that broke after our piece
00:09:35.449 || 00:09:35.459 || was published this morning and we were
00:09:37.310 || 00:09:37.320 || just talking about it a minute ago
00:09:39.590 || 00:09:39.600 || um is that the SEC is now investigating
00:09:41.269 || 00:09:41.279 || the Venture Capital firms who put money
00:09:43.850 || 00:09:43.860 || into FDX for their obvious lack of due
00:09:46.970 || 00:09:46.980 || diligence and care to their fiduciary
00:09:50.210 || 00:09:50.220 || I.E the LPS in their funds and that is
00:09:51.949 || 00:09:51.959 || an escalation as well and I think you
00:09:53.990 || 00:09:54.000 || know the the good we we went through an
00:09:54.949 || 00:09:54.959 || amazing
00:09:58.130 || 00:09:58.140 || error fraud and
00:10:00.350 || 00:10:00.360 || um ultimately price is the ultimate
00:10:02.150 || 00:10:02.160 || prosecutor and as these things collapse
00:10:03.889 || 00:10:03.899 || you know these these enforcement
00:10:04.970 || 00:10:04.980 || agencies tend to be much better
00:10:06.590 || 00:10:06.600 || archaeologists than they are detectives
00:10:08.449 || 00:10:08.459 || but once the crime scene is pretty clear
00:10:09.949 || 00:10:09.959 || they go about the task of bringing
00:10:11.690 || 00:10:11.700 || people to account and and holding people
00:10:13.790 || 00:10:13.800 || uh responsible for their for their
00:10:16.190 || 00:10:16.200 || crimes and and I do believe we are going
00:10:18.230 || 00:10:18.240 || to see the beginning of a trend of the
00:10:20.389 || 00:10:20.399 || personification of corporate crime which
00:10:21.889 || 00:10:21.899 || is the phrase we use in our piece this
00:10:22.610 || 00:10:22.620 || morning
00:10:24.590 || 00:10:24.600 || how do you see this all impacting other
00:10:26.509 || 00:10:26.519 || markets as well because as we move
00:10:29.269 || 00:10:29.279 || you're saying it at this moment it's not
00:10:31.430 || 00:10:31.440 || it is probably you're not going to be
00:10:33.410 || 00:10:33.420 || touching cryptocurrency
00:10:34.790 || 00:10:34.800 || um I know we have talked about precious
00:10:36.410 || 00:10:36.420 || metals in the past
00:10:38.630 || 00:10:38.640 || um we have seen quite a rally in the
00:10:40.970 || 00:10:40.980 || last couple months for a gold and silver
00:10:43.370 || 00:10:43.380 || do you anticipate this to continue and
00:10:44.569 || 00:10:44.579 || do you see a move away from
00:10:47.150 || 00:10:47.160 || cryptocurrency into other alternative
00:10:49.550 || 00:10:49.560 || currencies I think most of the Fiat that
00:10:50.750 || 00:10:50.760 || was floating around in the crypto
00:10:53.090 || 00:10:53.100 || universe is gone
00:10:54.710 || 00:10:54.720 || um and people ask us you know like the
00:10:56.389 || 00:10:56.399 || total value of all the crypto coins as
00:10:59.090 || 00:10:59.100 || expressed in US dollars is far far
00:11:00.769 || 00:11:00.779 || higher than the actual amount of US
00:11:02.750 || 00:11:02.760 || Dollars floating in the system that can
00:11:05.269 || 00:11:05.279 || be extracted through the payment rails
00:11:06.889 || 00:11:06.899 || um and if you ask me to put a floor on
00:11:07.550 || 00:11:07.560 || it
00:11:11.150 || 00:11:11.160 || I would say it um the maximum or a good
00:11:12.530 || 00:11:12.540 || estimate for the amount of Fiat in the
00:11:14.810 || 00:11:14.820 || system is usdc's market cap plus the
00:11:16.550 || 00:11:16.560 || other stable coin I believe paxos that's
00:11:18.949 || 00:11:18.959 || pretty well backed by treasuries
00:11:20.870 || 00:11:20.880 || um the sum of those two which is
00:11:22.850 || 00:11:22.860 || probably some fraction of the total
00:11:24.769 || 00:11:24.779 || value of what's in that universe that's
00:11:26.569 || 00:11:26.579 || already been pulled out so as it
00:11:28.490 || 00:11:28.500 || pertains to Precious Metals um to the
00:11:30.949 || 00:11:30.959 || extent that gold replaces Bitcoin as a
00:11:33.350 || 00:11:33.360 || safe haven at a time of Crisis and money
00:11:35.090 || 00:11:35.100 || that might have gone into that space is
00:11:36.949 || 00:11:36.959 || now at the margins flowing into the
00:11:38.210 || 00:11:38.220 || precious metal sector that's certainly
00:11:40.250 || 00:11:40.260 || bullish but I think
00:11:42.170 || 00:11:42.180 || um more bullish for gold and part of the
00:11:43.910 || 00:11:43.920 || reason why we're seeing gold catching a
00:11:45.650 || 00:11:45.660 || bit here in the new year is because
00:11:47.030 || 00:11:47.040 || central banks around the world seem to
00:11:49.430 || 00:11:49.440 || be stockpiling it and getting ready for
00:11:52.069 || 00:11:52.079 || a potential competitive uh currency to
00:11:53.810 || 00:11:53.820 || the US dollar which is something I
00:11:55.250 || 00:11:55.260 || believe we talked about in the past and
00:11:56.630 || 00:11:56.640 || our good friend Luke Roman has been
00:11:58.430 || 00:11:58.440 || chronicling and Grant Williams just put
00:12:00.530 || 00:12:00.540 || out another great podcast with him um
00:12:02.509 || 00:12:02.519 || called shifts happen where he goes
00:12:04.009 || 00:12:04.019 || through his thesis pretty thoroughly I'd
00:12:06.350 || 00:12:06.360 || recommend everybody go listen to that so
00:12:08.509 || 00:12:08.519 || I do think the move and gold probably
00:12:11.170 || 00:12:11.180 || has more to do with global
00:12:13.730 || 00:12:13.740 || pre-positioning for potential changes in
00:12:16.069 || 00:12:16.079 || the in the way currencies facilitate
00:12:19.130 || 00:12:19.140 || International Trade than it does for
00:12:20.990 || 00:12:21.000 || um as a consequence of the collapse of
00:12:22.310 || 00:12:22.320 || crypto as a potential Safe Haven
00:12:24.590 || 00:12:24.600 || competitor to Gold a lot of people out
00:12:28.009 || 00:12:28.019 || there seem to be confident that 2023 is
00:12:29.810 || 00:12:29.820 || going to be positive for the precious
00:12:32.090 || 00:12:32.100 || metals we've seen that as as we've
00:12:33.350 || 00:12:33.360 || mentioned you know in the last couple
00:12:35.990 || 00:12:36.000 || months as central banks are accumulating
00:12:38.389 || 00:12:38.399 || more gold do you anticipate that to
00:12:40.490 || 00:12:40.500 || continue this year a very important
00:12:42.050 || 00:12:42.060 || thing happened since we last talked
00:12:43.970 || 00:12:43.980 || which is President XI visited Saudi
00:12:46.970 || 00:12:46.980 || Arabia and um his speech should be read
00:12:51.410 || 00:12:51.420 || closely by all uh precious metals Bulls
00:12:53.329 || 00:12:53.339 || because he outlines in very clear
00:12:55.509 || 00:12:55.519 || language plain black and white language
00:12:57.889 || 00:12:57.899 || that his intent is to collaborate with
00:13:01.009 || 00:13:01.019 || Russia and the oil producing countries
00:13:04.490 || 00:13:04.500 || to establish a new way to um to
00:13:05.990 || 00:13:06.000 || facilitate International Trade I would
00:13:08.389 || 00:13:08.399 || recommend everybody go read 10 pulsner's
00:13:10.310 || 00:13:10.320 || latest piece which is really a seven
00:13:13.069 || 00:13:13.079 || year summary of Luke Roman's work on the
00:13:15.829 || 00:13:15.839 || matter a really fantastic piece Zoltan
00:13:17.810 || 00:13:17.820 || from credit Swiss that covers all of
00:13:19.790 || 00:13:19.800 || this and if those two brilliant thinkers
00:13:21.530 || 00:13:21.540 || are correct
00:13:23.030 || 00:13:23.040 || um the price of gold is going to be in
00:13:24.410 || 00:13:24.420 || for an interesting ride this year
00:13:26.629 || 00:13:26.639 || volatility will certainly be there but
00:13:28.850 || 00:13:28.860 || we own gold I should I should disclose
00:13:29.990 || 00:13:30.000 || of course we have our own physical
00:13:32.389 || 00:13:32.399 || Holdings but we occasionally put an
00:13:35.269 || 00:13:35.279 || allocation of of our investable dollars
00:13:38.269 || 00:13:38.279 || into Sprott physical gold trust which is
00:13:41.389 || 00:13:41.399 || how we express a bullish view on gold in
00:13:43.970 || 00:13:43.980 || our own trading accounts and and we have
00:13:45.769 || 00:13:45.779 || a pretty reasonable allocation of our
00:13:47.449 || 00:13:47.459 || portfolio towards world now it's not a
00:13:48.590 || 00:13:48.600 || stock recommendation it's not going to
00:13:50.030 || 00:13:50.040 || do your own due diligence but we are
00:13:52.730 || 00:13:52.740 || relatively bullish gold uh in the short
00:13:55.190 || 00:13:55.200 || medium and long term and I think if the
00:13:57.590 || 00:13:57.600 || brics countries do make a move for a
00:13:59.329 || 00:13:59.339 || currency backed by Commodities settled
00:14:01.850 || 00:14:01.860 || in Gold the the sort of market market
00:14:03.889 || 00:14:03.899 || cap that gold would have to achieve on a
00:14:05.389 || 00:14:05.399 || global basis uh would probably have to
00:14:08.030 || 00:14:08.040 || rise from here of course all depends on
00:14:09.710 || 00:14:09.720 || the US's response to this and whether
00:14:12.590 || 00:14:12.600 || War breaks out in Taiwan and the you
00:14:15.470 || 00:14:15.480 || know various other scenarios but um but
00:14:18.230 || 00:14:18.240 || I think that is more the that tail risk
00:14:19.970 || 00:14:19.980 || of upside is is probably more
00:14:21.410 || 00:14:21.420 || responsible for moving the price of gold
00:14:23.629 || 00:14:23.639 || as we as I said earlier now from your
00:14:25.730 || 00:14:25.740 || research on what the brics countries may
00:14:28.370 || 00:14:28.380 || be doing and when it comes to this new
00:14:31.069 || 00:14:31.079 || Reserve currency being gold-backed or
00:14:33.889 || 00:14:33.899 || settled in Gold how much of it do you
00:14:36.470 || 00:14:36.480 || see gold being involved and other
00:14:38.389 || 00:14:38.399 || Commodities being involved so I should
00:14:40.310 || 00:14:40.320 || say it's uh I'm summarizing the research
00:14:41.449 || 00:14:41.459 || of others and I wouldn't want to take
00:14:43.790 || 00:14:43.800 || credit for their work but Luke Roman in
00:14:44.870 || 00:14:44.880 || particular has been on this for many
00:14:46.129 || 00:14:46.139 || years and we're big fans of his and
00:14:48.530 || 00:14:48.540 || we're paying customers of his
00:14:50.449 || 00:14:50.459 || um and um you know the pieces have been
00:14:51.829 || 00:14:51.839 || put in place for a long time so if you
00:14:54.769 || 00:14:54.779 || think this is a short-term event then
00:14:56.930 || 00:14:56.940 || you're thinking that this will occur
00:14:58.189 || 00:14:58.199 || um rather quickly but if you've been
00:14:59.870 || 00:14:59.880 || looking at this over the long Horizon
00:15:02.389 || 00:15:02.399 || like Luke and his team have you see that
00:15:03.769 || 00:15:03.779 || the pieces have been put in place since
00:15:04.730 || 00:15:04.740 || the beginning of the global financial
00:15:07.970 || 00:15:07.980 || crisis and today in Shanghai you can
00:15:09.170 || 00:15:09.180 || exchange
00:15:11.629 || 00:15:11.639 || um gold uh you could exchange one for
00:15:13.670 || 00:15:13.680 || gold so there's a physical gold market
00:15:15.250 || 00:15:15.260 || where International
00:15:17.449 || 00:15:17.459 || holders of the of the Chinese currency
00:15:19.730 || 00:15:19.740 || can basically take the value out of
00:15:21.829 || 00:15:21.839 || China in the form of physical gold and
00:15:23.150 || 00:15:23.160 || they have an all contract they have a
00:15:24.829 || 00:15:24.839 || gold contract they have you know and
00:15:26.509 || 00:15:26.519 || again if I've encouraged people to go
00:15:28.610 || 00:15:28.620 || read a speech because the the exact
00:15:30.110 || 00:15:30.120 || speech is never going to be summarized
00:15:32.210 || 00:15:32.220 || correctly in the western media and this
00:15:35.150 || 00:15:35.160 || is an example where Zoltan actually does
00:15:37.189 || 00:15:37.199 || cover it but he's not sort of mainstream
00:15:39.170 || 00:15:39.180 || Western media he's a bank researcher you
00:15:40.670 || 00:15:40.680 || know and puts up these amazing pieces
00:15:43.250 || 00:15:43.260 || once or twice a month and you can find
00:15:44.689 || 00:15:44.699 || it on Twitter you just search you know
00:15:46.550 || 00:15:46.560 || Zoltan latest piece and I'm sure you'll
00:15:47.750 || 00:15:47.760 || find it
00:15:50.410 || 00:15:50.420 || um it's pretty amazing he goes through
00:15:54.050 || 00:15:54.060 || each aspect of his speech and then ties
00:15:57.290 || 00:15:57.300 || it to a modern uh consequence of that
00:15:59.210 || 00:15:59.220 || and and it was really really well done
00:16:00.889 || 00:16:00.899 || and then of course Luke's follow-up
00:16:02.329 || 00:16:02.339 || appears on the Grant Williams podcast
00:16:03.949 || 00:16:03.959 || was really a must listen as well for
00:16:05.810 || 00:16:05.820 || those who haven't yet heard it published
00:16:07.009 || 00:16:07.019 || earlier this week
00:16:09.170 || 00:16:09.180 || no when it comes to the energy markets I
00:16:10.970 || 00:16:10.980 || know this is very much tied into this
00:16:12.829 || 00:16:12.839 || because something that has propped up
00:16:15.290 || 00:16:15.300 || the US dollar is the petrodollar you
00:16:17.269 || 00:16:17.279 || know oil being traded in US dollars but
00:16:20.750 || 00:16:20.760 || this move by the bricks to create a new
00:16:22.730 || 00:16:22.740 || Reserve currency definitely seems to
00:16:24.769 || 00:16:24.779 || threaten that and countries are even
00:16:27.350 || 00:16:27.360 || starting now to trade
00:16:30.170 || 00:16:30.180 || um to buy energy and other in currencies
00:16:31.910 || 00:16:31.920 || other than the US dollar
00:16:34.069 || 00:16:34.079 || um can you expand kind of how the energy
00:16:36.949 || 00:16:36.959 || Market ties into this new Reserve
00:16:39.290 || 00:16:39.300 || currency in the energy space and as you
00:16:40.670 || 00:16:40.680 || know energy is life and we've talked
00:16:42.290 || 00:16:42.300 || about it at length and previous
00:16:44.389 || 00:16:44.399 || appearances you need you know energy
00:16:46.189 || 00:16:46.199 || producers
00:16:48.769 || 00:16:48.779 || um need to know that they can store the
00:16:51.230 || 00:16:51.240 || profits of their energy production
00:16:53.449 || 00:16:53.459 || in a form that preserves their
00:16:54.769 || 00:16:54.779 || purchasing power for when they need it
00:16:56.210 || 00:16:56.220 || otherwise it makes more sense for them
00:16:57.829 || 00:16:57.839 || to just leave it in the ground
00:17:00.410 || 00:17:00.420 || and to the extent that
00:17:02.449 || 00:17:02.459 || after the global financial crisis in
00:17:04.189 || 00:17:04.199 || 2008 09
00:17:07.010 || 00:17:07.020 || the U.S fed has decided to
00:17:09.110 || 00:17:09.120 || to focus Inward and focus on the
00:17:10.610 || 00:17:10.620 || domestic impact of their policy as
00:17:12.829 || 00:17:12.839 || opposed to keeping the dollar as good as
00:17:15.949 || 00:17:15.959 || gold for oil again another phrase that
00:17:18.710 || 00:17:18.720 || Laura from Luke the
00:17:21.169 || 00:17:21.179 || the the oil producing countries then
00:17:22.970 || 00:17:22.980 || have a conundrum because of you know
00:17:25.850 || 00:17:25.860 || inflation and and the uh weakening of
00:17:26.870 || 00:17:26.880 || the dollar so on and so on and there's
00:17:29.450 || 00:17:29.460 || lots of people who have an opposing view
00:17:31.370 || 00:17:31.380 || and and I I just happen to believe
00:17:33.850 || 00:17:33.860 || Luke's work but by and large The the
00:17:37.250 || 00:17:37.260 || Reserve currency in the reserve asset in
00:17:38.330 || 00:17:38.340 || this case are functionally the same
00:17:39.710 || 00:17:39.720 || thing tonight which is the US dollar in
00:17:41.450 || 00:17:41.460 || short-term treasuries and short-term
00:17:43.070 || 00:17:43.080 || treasuries is just another form of money
00:17:44.270 || 00:17:44.280 || really
00:17:48.169 || 00:17:48.179 || um so the reserve asset uh is is what
00:17:49.850 || 00:17:49.860 || needs to change almost more than the
00:17:51.650 || 00:17:51.660 || reserve currency in the minds of the oil
00:17:53.450 || 00:17:53.460 || and gas producers because they need to
00:17:55.010 || 00:17:55.020 || be able to store these products in a way
00:17:58.190 || 00:17:58.200 || these these uh excess reserves uh in a
00:17:59.630 || 00:17:59.640 || way that preserves their purchasing
00:18:00.950 || 00:18:00.960 || power and then for countries like China
00:18:03.169 || 00:18:03.179 || who are net exporters as well
00:18:05.930 || 00:18:05.940 || um they need to to be able to buy oil at
00:18:08.450 || 00:18:08.460 || their current Reserve balance uh and and
00:18:10.190 || 00:18:10.200 || that's where the big mismatch is so both
00:18:12.110 || 00:18:12.120 || you know the Saudis and the Chinese in
00:18:13.490 || 00:18:13.500 || this case
00:18:16.490 || 00:18:16.500 || um would have a desire to not have the
00:18:17.990 || 00:18:18.000 || value of their reserves be in the hands
00:18:19.850 || 00:18:19.860 || of the women's of the U.S fed and then
00:18:20.750 || 00:18:20.760 || of course
00:18:22.310 || 00:18:22.320 || the
00:18:25.310 || 00:18:25.320 || um the the grabbing of the Russian
00:18:26.930 || 00:18:26.940 || reserves has freaked everybody out in
00:18:29.690 || 00:18:29.700 || this game and we wrote a piece back
00:18:31.250 || 00:18:31.260 || while we were still a free newsletter
00:18:33.350 || 00:18:33.360 || called on the cusp of an economic
00:18:34.430 || 00:18:34.440 || singularity
00:18:36.710 || 00:18:36.720 || where we talked about the seizing of the
00:18:38.270 || 00:18:38.280 || Russian Reserve is going to have major
00:18:41.029 || 00:18:41.039 || decades long aftershocks as both the
00:18:42.650 || 00:18:42.660 || Chinese and the Saudis look at that and
00:18:45.110 || 00:18:45.120 || say are our reserves safe maybe we
00:18:46.190 || 00:18:46.200 || should swap those reserves into
00:18:48.289 || 00:18:48.299 || something that can't be seized I don't
00:18:49.850 || 00:18:49.860 || know like a digital goal for example
00:18:53.210 || 00:18:53.220 || that is you know that can be redeemed
00:18:55.490 || 00:18:55.500 || for physical uh at an appropriate window
00:18:57.110 || 00:18:57.120 || so a lot of moving Parts a lot of
00:18:58.730 || 00:18:58.740 || counter arguments U.S military presence
00:19:01.669 || 00:19:01.679 || Saudis defense needs China Taiwan
00:19:03.590 || 00:19:03.600 || there's all kinds of scenarios that can
00:19:05.690 || 00:19:05.700 || make this maybe just like the hopes and
00:19:07.610 || 00:19:07.620 || Fantasies the hopes and fantasies of a
00:19:10.549 || 00:19:10.559 || lifelong gold bull but it certainly
00:19:12.590 || 00:19:12.600 || seems if you read G's speech and you see
00:19:14.810 || 00:19:14.820 || the behaviors uh you see India's
00:19:18.049 || 00:19:18.059 || Behavior you see um you know Russia's
00:19:19.370 || 00:19:19.380 || Behavior Putin has been talking about
00:19:22.070 || 00:19:22.080 || this for a very long time the signs are
00:19:24.650 || 00:19:24.660 || pointing to
00:19:25.909 || 00:19:25.919 || um significant change and then the fact
00:19:27.289 || 00:19:27.299 || that somebody who is as well respected
00:19:29.450 || 00:19:29.460 || and and has such depth of expertise of
00:19:30.890 || 00:19:30.900 || how the plumbing works that Zoltan would
00:19:32.150 || 00:19:32.160 || put that in writing and put it out under
00:19:34.370 || 00:19:34.380 || credit swiss's Masthead I think is a
00:19:36.890 || 00:19:36.900 || pretty important sign that the narrative
00:19:38.810 || 00:19:38.820 || might be might be switching here and so
00:19:40.789 || 00:19:40.799 || yeah we're long gold more bullish gold
00:19:43.190 || 00:19:43.200 || doesn't mean go out and buy gold
00:19:44.750 || 00:19:44.760 || um it just means that that's our
00:19:46.669 || 00:19:46.679 || personal View definitely and when it
00:19:48.650 || 00:19:48.660 || comes to the energy Market in general we
00:19:50.450 || 00:19:50.460 || saw a lot of shocks to the system with
00:19:52.850 || 00:19:52.860 || the Ukraine Russia war and many other
00:19:56.390 || 00:19:56.400 || events last year a lot of volatility uh
00:19:58.190 || 00:19:58.200 || what do you expect if you want to what
00:19:59.450 || 00:19:59.460 || are the main things that you're looking
00:20:04.190 || 00:20:04.200 || for uh in energy in 2023 right now in
00:20:06.470 || 00:20:06.480 || the short term we wrote a piece last
00:20:07.669 || 00:20:07.679 || week I think was called The Winds of
00:20:09.590 || 00:20:09.600 || Gaia and essentially the only thing that
00:20:10.909 || 00:20:10.919 || matters right now for short-term energy
00:20:12.409 || 00:20:12.419 || is the weather and Europe has gone
00:20:14.450 || 00:20:14.460 || through an incredibly warm spell which
00:20:16.370 || 00:20:16.380 || is great fantastic has allowed them to
00:20:18.110 || 00:20:18.120 || shave off much of the worst case
00:20:19.450 || 00:20:19.460 || scenario risk that we were worried about
00:20:22.010 || 00:20:22.020 || correctly they spent a half a trillion
00:20:24.049 || 00:20:24.059 || dollars to buy enough BTUs to get them
00:20:25.250 || 00:20:25.260 || looks like to get them through the
00:20:27.350 || 00:20:27.360 || winter good for them
00:20:29.090 || 00:20:29.100 || um especially when U.S natural gas is in
00:20:29.930 || 00:20:29.940 || free fraud because we're seeing
00:20:32.090 || 00:20:32.100 || unseasonably warm weather ironically of
00:20:33.350 || 00:20:33.360 || course you know the price of fossil
00:20:35.810 || 00:20:35.820 || fuels is safe by global warming
00:20:38.330 || 00:20:38.340 || um but it is what it is so the weather
00:20:40.010 || 00:20:40.020 || is the most important factor that looks
00:20:41.990 || 00:20:42.000 || like some of the long-range forecasts a
00:20:43.130 || 00:20:43.140 || couple of weeks out call for a
00:20:45.169 || 00:20:45.179 || substantial cold spell in Europe if that
00:20:46.430 || 00:20:46.440 || plays out
00:20:48.289 || 00:20:48.299 || um we hope it doesn't but that could
00:20:50.930 || 00:20:50.940 || could stress the system in ways that few
00:20:53.690 || 00:20:53.700 || um few expected today and I'll just
00:20:55.250 || 00:20:55.260 || close this answer by saying the worst
00:20:56.810 || 00:20:56.820 || thing that could happen
00:20:59.450 || 00:20:59.460 || is the weather blesses Europe and they
00:21:01.190 || 00:21:01.200 || misconstrue good luck as intelligence
00:21:02.810 || 00:21:02.820 || and they learn none of the lessons they
00:21:04.970 || 00:21:04.980 || need to fix things for next winter and
00:21:06.350 || 00:21:06.360 || then next winter turns out to be a cold
00:21:08.330 || 00:21:08.340 || one and then you know they live to
00:21:10.130 || 00:21:10.140 || regret they're in action today this
00:21:12.770 || 00:21:12.780 || reprieve from Mother Nature should be
00:21:14.510 || 00:21:14.520 || seized upon
00:21:16.610 || 00:21:16.620 || to correct the mistakes of the past not
00:21:19.190 || 00:21:19.200 || to validate them unfortunately based on
00:21:21.350 || 00:21:21.360 || some of the things we're seeing out of
00:21:22.789 || 00:21:22.799 || the sort of professional commentators in
00:21:23.810 || 00:21:23.820 || Europe
00:21:25.610 || 00:21:25.620 || um we doubt that those proper lessons
00:21:26.930 || 00:21:26.940 || are being learned
00:21:29.450 || 00:21:29.460 || and I know in the U.S here uh your
00:21:31.669 || 00:21:31.679 || latest one of your latest pieces on uh
00:21:34.190 || 00:21:34.200 || substack was about changes in the U.S
00:21:37.130 || 00:21:37.140 || energy Market especially in people's
00:21:39.830 || 00:21:39.840 || homes can you expand on that and kind of
00:21:41.810 || 00:21:41.820 || the uh I guess climate change narrative
00:21:44.390 || 00:21:44.400 || that is pushing for those changes yeah
00:21:47.390 || 00:21:47.400 || we we wrote a fun piece called a home
00:21:49.850 || 00:21:49.860 || near you which basically predicted and
00:21:51.289 || 00:21:51.299 || it's already being validated by some of
00:21:52.970 || 00:21:52.980 || the pieces we're seeing in the
00:21:55.010 || 00:21:55.020 || mainstream media the days after we put
00:21:57.110 || 00:21:57.120 || that piece out the words heat pump will
00:21:59.750 || 00:21:59.760 || be on every environmentalist lips for
00:22:02.029 || 00:22:02.039 || the year there's a war on the American
00:22:04.909 || 00:22:04.919 || home furnace if you heat your home with
00:22:07.970 || 00:22:07.980 || natural gas uh in particular they're
00:22:10.190 || 00:22:10.200 || coming for you they want to replace that
00:22:11.570 || 00:22:11.580 || with what's known as a heat pump which
00:22:13.070 || 00:22:13.080 || is essentially a sophisticated version
00:22:15.470 || 00:22:15.480 || of an air conditioning unit which can
00:22:17.990 || 00:22:18.000 || both heat and cool your home after
00:22:19.490 || 00:22:19.500 || writing the piece we've been deluged
00:22:20.990 || 00:22:21.000 || with emails from people who own these
00:22:22.430 || 00:22:22.440 || things and are bemoaning their
00:22:23.930 || 00:22:23.940 || inadequacies we didn't really get into
00:22:25.730 || 00:22:25.740 || that in the piece in the piece instead
00:22:26.870 || 00:22:26.880 || we just identified who was going to win
00:22:29.149 || 00:22:29.159 || in and who was going to make a lot of
00:22:29.870 || 00:22:29.880 || money because of this
00:22:31.430 || 00:22:31.440 || government-sponsored environmentalist
00:22:34.850 || 00:22:34.860 || sort of Bonanza and um and and you know
00:22:36.890 || 00:22:36.900 || HVAC companies and furnace repair
00:22:39.049 || 00:22:39.059 || technicians and private Equity firms are
00:22:40.909 || 00:22:40.919 || rushing into the space and and all the
00:22:43.190 || 00:22:43.200 || money that is being offered to consumers
00:22:44.510 || 00:22:44.520 || in the form of credits will end up in
00:22:45.710 || 00:22:45.720 || the pockets of these individuals and
00:22:48.070 || 00:22:48.080 || they will make a lot of money but 2023
00:22:50.930 || 00:22:50.940 || 2023 is a year of the heat pump you will
00:22:53.270 || 00:22:53.280 || see no shortage of propaganda to that
00:22:55.490 || 00:22:55.500 || effect and if you have a furnace or you
00:22:58.310 || 00:22:58.320 || cook at home using natural gas the
00:23:00.169 || 00:23:00.179 || environmentalist Progressive ESG
00:23:02.450 || 00:23:02.460 || movement is gunning for you what is your
00:23:04.010 || 00:23:04.020 || perspective on how people can be aware
00:23:05.390 || 00:23:05.400 || and prepared for this
00:23:07.850 || 00:23:07.860 || yeah so we went into who was going to
00:23:09.409 || 00:23:09.419 || win you know like made a joke that if
00:23:10.370 || 00:23:10.380 || you have a youngster in your life
00:23:12.350 || 00:23:12.360 || considering an expensive degree in a
00:23:13.610 || 00:23:13.620 || liberal arts school you might want to
00:23:15.049 || 00:23:15.059 || get them into the furnace repair trade
00:23:17.149 || 00:23:17.159 || because they're going to be in in high
00:23:19.490 || 00:23:19.500 || demand as people try to keep their
00:23:20.990 || 00:23:21.000 || existing furnaces running for as long as
00:23:22.310 || 00:23:22.320 || possible you know and the piece we
00:23:24.049 || 00:23:24.059 || described how California has already
00:23:26.450 || 00:23:26.460 || banned the installation of new furnaces
00:23:29.210 || 00:23:29.220 || not just a new construction but in homes
00:23:31.070 || 00:23:31.080 || where the furnace breaks you have to
00:23:32.270 || 00:23:32.280 || replace it now with a heat pump
00:23:35.930 || 00:23:35.940 || basically and the whole definition of
00:23:37.490 || 00:23:37.500 || what a furnace means and how to repair
00:23:39.110 || 00:23:39.120 || it we believe is going to change you
00:23:40.370 || 00:23:40.380 || know so I would be stocking up on
00:23:41.750 || 00:23:41.760 || furnace parts
00:23:43.310 || 00:23:43.320 || um all kidding aside but like you're
00:23:44.210 || 00:23:44.220 || going to want to keep your furnace
00:23:46.070 || 00:23:46.080 || running well and keep it in good shape
00:23:47.470 || 00:23:47.480 || and make sure it gets maintained because
00:23:49.490 || 00:23:49.500 || if the furnace is deemed to be
00:23:50.750 || 00:23:50.760 || irreparable and you live in California
00:23:53.149 || 00:23:53.159 || today which is something we expect to
00:23:55.310 || 00:23:55.320 || propagate to other Progressive states on
00:23:57.230 || 00:23:57.240 || the east coast and perhaps on the west
00:23:58.909 || 00:23:58.919 || coast as well
00:24:00.470 || 00:24:00.480 || um they don't want you to own and
00:24:02.029 || 00:24:02.039 || operate a furnace in your home and so
00:24:04.010 || 00:24:04.020 || they will do anything they can to force
00:24:06.770 || 00:24:06.780 || you into a potentially sub-optimal or
00:24:08.630 || 00:24:08.640 || inadequate source of heating especially
00:24:09.950 || 00:24:09.960 || at the times when you need it the most
00:24:11.930 || 00:24:11.940 || which is during cold spells in the
00:24:13.789 || 00:24:13.799 || winter and that's also going to put
00:24:15.169 || 00:24:15.179 || significant strain on the electricity
00:24:17.169 || 00:24:17.179 || grid so to the extent that you can
00:24:20.029 || 00:24:20.039 || prepare for long-term power outages in
00:24:21.350 || 00:24:21.360 || the ways we've described in the past
00:24:23.810 || 00:24:23.820 || that's also should be top of mind the
00:24:25.010 || 00:24:25.020 || whole objective is to Electrify
00:24:26.750 || 00:24:26.760 || everything but also to not allow for
00:24:28.970 || 00:24:28.980 || sufficient development of reliable
00:24:31.310 || 00:24:31.320 || electricity generation let alone the
00:24:32.870 || 00:24:32.880 || transmission lines to get them to your
00:24:35.270 || 00:24:35.280 || home and so if you replace your furnace
00:24:36.529 || 00:24:36.539 || with a heat pump you're going to be more
00:24:38.510 || 00:24:38.520 || dependable more dependent on a less
00:24:40.130 || 00:24:40.140 || reliable grid that will be more
00:24:41.990 || 00:24:42.000 || expensive to operate and will result in
00:24:44.510 || 00:24:44.520 || even more CO2 emissions than the magical
00:24:47.930 || 00:24:47.940 || heat pump claims to be saving but mostly
00:24:49.310 || 00:24:49.320 || we wrote that piece to have a little fun
00:24:50.930 || 00:24:50.940 || and to get on people's Radars that the
00:24:54.169 || 00:24:54.179 || words heat pump will be all the rage in
00:24:55.730 || 00:24:55.740 || 2023 and every time you see a story
00:24:58.010 || 00:24:58.020 || attacking a furnace attacking home
00:25:00.890 || 00:25:00.900 || cooking using natural gas or praising
00:25:02.510 || 00:25:02.520 || heat pumps remember that the green
00:25:04.789 || 00:25:04.799 || chicken told you it was coming
