00:00:04.550 || 00:00:04.560 || I think that's why there's so much
00:00:08.030 || 00:00:08.040 || buildup of tension right now between the
00:00:11.270 || 00:00:11.280 || West under the U.S leadership and the

00:01:39.590 || 00:01:39.600 || always enjoy speaking with you well it's
00:01:41.210 || 00:01:41.220 || great to have you and the first topic I
00:01:43.069 || 00:01:43.079 || did want to discuss today
00:01:45.469 || 00:01:45.479 || um is central banks buying gold and what
00:01:47.090 || 00:01:47.100 || we've seen this year I know it's been
00:01:49.850 || 00:01:49.860 || record buying and what this may signal
00:01:51.830 || 00:01:51.840 || for kind of people have been talking
00:01:54.109 || 00:01:54.119 || about the brics countries developing a
00:01:55.609 || 00:01:55.619 || new Reserve currency that might be
00:01:56.929 || 00:01:56.939 || gold-backed
00:01:58.670 || 00:01:58.680 || um could we get an update from you on
00:02:00.770 || 00:02:00.780 || what you're seeing right now and the
00:02:02.749 || 00:02:02.759 || significance of central banks buying
00:02:03.830 || 00:02:03.840 || gold
00:02:07.310 || 00:02:07.320 || yes I actually spoke earlier today in in
00:02:10.550 || 00:02:10.560 || my daily video about it because uh this
00:02:13.130 || 00:02:13.140 || article came out in the Ft saying that
00:02:16.309 || 00:02:16.319 || November had been a huge by month like
00:02:20.150 || 00:02:20.160 || 700 tons and prior to that uh the third
00:02:22.850 || 00:02:22.860 || quarter was big but it was like 400 tons
00:02:25.250 || 00:02:25.260 || so in one month they did more than they
00:02:27.290 || 00:02:27.300 || did in the third quarter and this was
00:02:29.690 || 00:02:29.700 || reported by the world go Council and the
00:02:31.670 || 00:02:31.680 || speculation of course is that China and
00:02:35.449 || 00:02:35.459 || Russia are now buying a lot of gold and
00:02:38.510 || 00:02:38.520 || I think the uh the Russians there the
00:02:41.690 || 00:02:41.700 || probably the second biggest producer uh
00:02:44.570 || 00:02:44.580 || one of the top producers of gold and uh
00:02:47.150 || 00:02:47.160 || they they've been blocked out of the
00:02:51.650 || 00:02:51.660 || western market and the lbma so I I think
00:02:53.930 || 00:02:53.940 || the speculations that they're selling
00:02:57.770 || 00:02:57.780 || direct to to the Chinese now as well and
00:03:00.170 || 00:03:00.180 || the brics countries as well uh they're
00:03:03.110 || 00:03:03.120 || they're they're buying gold uh and it's
00:03:06.589 || 00:03:06.599 || I think the the uh the biggest uh
00:03:10.369 || 00:03:10.379 || buying by Central Bank since 1967 which
00:03:12.770 || 00:03:12.780 || was like almost the end of the London
00:03:17.330 || 00:03:17.340 || Gold pool which was like a covert
00:03:18.229 || 00:03:18.239 || um
00:03:20.509 || 00:03:20.519 || group of central banks from Western
00:03:22.790 || 00:03:22.800 || Europe and North America and Australia
00:03:25.630 || 00:03:25.640 || they're trying to keep the price at 35
00:03:29.210 || 00:03:29.220 || dollars an ounce back then and then the
00:03:30.830 || 00:03:30.840 || French gave up and they said well
00:03:32.630 || 00:03:32.640 || there's too many the Americans are
00:03:34.850 || 00:03:34.860 || printing too many dollars we want our
00:03:36.830 || 00:03:36.840 || gold we're going to redeem it and and
00:03:40.009 || 00:03:40.019 || that London Gold book collapsed in 1968
00:03:43.490 || 00:03:43.500 || and that eventually led to the uh end of
00:03:45.710 || 00:03:45.720 || the original Bretton Wood system on
00:03:49.250 || 00:03:49.260 || August 15 1971. so it's very significant
00:03:52.449 || 00:03:52.459 || what's happening now I think because
00:03:55.910 || 00:03:55.920 || I think the uh the brics countries under
00:03:59.089 || 00:03:59.099 || the leadership of Russia and China are
00:04:02.030 || 00:04:02.040 || breaking away from the old dollar system
00:04:05.270 || 00:04:05.280 || that's been around since 1944.
00:04:08.509 || 00:04:08.519 || I know Nixon closed the gold winning 71
00:04:10.550 || 00:04:10.560 || but the dollar is still the major
00:04:14.149 || 00:04:14.159 || Reserve currency and uh yeah it's very
00:04:16.729 || 00:04:16.739 || significant I think no it seems like we
00:04:18.469 || 00:04:18.479 || are possibly going to see like a new
00:04:20.629 || 00:04:20.639 || Bretton Woods last time with the
00:04:21.949 || 00:04:21.959 || original Bretton Woods you know the
00:04:24.890 || 00:04:24.900 || dollar was on top the US was on top
00:04:26.870 || 00:04:26.880 || um how is that gonna how is this shift
00:04:29.450 || 00:04:29.460 || going to impact
00:04:31.670 || 00:04:31.680 || um people living in the U.S and also
00:04:33.469 || 00:04:33.479 || people in the west as well for example
00:04:35.770 || 00:04:35.780 || in Europe Where You Are
00:04:37.370 || 00:04:37.380 || yes
00:04:39.950 || 00:04:39.960 || um and that this new Bretton Woods if we
00:04:42.530 || 00:04:42.540 || have it it could be just uh the brics
00:04:44.270 || 00:04:44.280 || countries meeting because don't forget
00:04:47.629 || 00:04:47.639 || the Bretton Woods in 1944
00:04:49.610 || 00:04:49.620 || um it wasn't all the countries of the
00:04:53.450 || 00:04:53.460 || world that met then uh so how it impacts
00:04:56.150 || 00:04:56.160 || the United States domestically and the
00:04:58.310 || 00:04:58.320 || other Western countries uh whose
00:04:59.930 || 00:04:59.940 || currencies are really packed to the
00:05:02.510 || 00:05:02.520 || dollar well it means that there will be
00:05:08.030 || 00:05:08.040 || less demand for for dollars so less
00:05:10.850 || 00:05:10.860 || demand for dollars means that countries
00:05:13.490 || 00:05:13.500 || like China and other countries uh in the
00:05:15.650 || 00:05:15.660 || brics and Global South as they call it
00:05:18.590 || 00:05:18.600 || will have to hold less dollar reserves
00:05:20.629 || 00:05:20.639 || and they'll be buying less treasuries
00:05:23.270 || 00:05:23.280 || and that means that uh
00:05:25.610 || 00:05:25.620 || bond yields are probably going to rise
00:05:27.529 || 00:05:27.539 || because there is not going to be that
00:05:31.249 || 00:05:31.259 || demand for the dollar and it's gonna
00:05:34.610 || 00:05:34.620 || sift through to the uh to the Euro to
00:05:36.830 || 00:05:36.840 || the British pound to the Canadian dollar
00:05:39.830 || 00:05:39.840 || to the Australian dollar all the way
00:05:43.070 || 00:05:43.080 || Western currencies and um
00:05:46.430 || 00:05:46.440 || we saw recently as well that China and
00:05:49.189 || 00:05:49.199 || Saudi Arabia and the gulf cooperation
00:05:52.370 || 00:05:52.380 || countries uh did a deal a three to five
00:05:55.850 || 00:05:55.860 || year deal to for China to buy their oil
00:05:58.790 || 00:05:58.800 || and gas and for them to get payment in
00:06:02.270 || 00:06:02.280 || uh you won or the petrol you won so
00:06:05.210 || 00:06:05.220 || that's a highly significant I think as
00:06:07.909 || 00:06:07.919 || well that's so all it will mean if
00:06:09.890 || 00:06:09.900 || there's less demand for dollars uh
00:06:12.110 || 00:06:12.120 || dollars are going to become uh worth
00:06:15.529 || 00:06:15.539 || less and when the currency is becomes
00:06:18.290 || 00:06:18.300 || worth less it buys less so that means
00:06:21.170 || 00:06:21.180 || higher prices a lower standard of living
00:06:23.990 || 00:06:24.000 || but I think there's a silver lining the
00:06:25.909 || 00:06:25.919 || Silver Lining is that
00:06:28.370 || 00:06:28.380 || uh we're gonna have to learn in the west
00:06:31.730 || 00:06:31.740 || again especially in the US that we have
00:06:33.950 || 00:06:33.960 || to earn our way in the world because the
00:06:37.129 || 00:06:37.139 || US has been able to just uh
00:06:40.010 || 00:06:40.020 || print dollars out of thin air and buy
00:06:42.710 || 00:06:42.720 || whatever they want from whatever country
00:06:44.870 || 00:06:44.880 || they want but I think that's coming to
00:06:47.749 || 00:06:47.759 || an end so it will mean I think a more
00:06:50.870 || 00:06:50.880 || honest system but it it will feel feel
00:06:53.330 || 00:06:53.340 || painful because I think a lot of people
00:06:55.010 || 00:06:55.020 || are not aware that this is going on
00:06:56.749 || 00:06:56.759 || there's so many distractions in the
00:06:59.029 || 00:06:59.039 || world as you as you know
00:07:01.309 || 00:07:01.319 || a lot of people aren't also aware that
00:07:04.309 || 00:07:04.319 || most of the dollars in existence are
00:07:06.110 || 00:07:06.120 || actually held outside the US so if we do
00:07:09.170 || 00:07:09.180 || see uh decrease in demand for dollars
00:07:11.510 || 00:07:11.520 || and dollars coming back to the US that
00:07:13.249 || 00:07:13.259 || just increases the money supply which
00:07:15.350 || 00:07:15.360 || will just make inflation worse your
00:07:18.050 || 00:07:18.060 || perspective on that yeah physical
00:07:21.589 || 00:07:21.599 || dollars uh I think like in Russia they
00:07:23.930 || 00:07:23.940 || used to hold a lot of physical dollars
00:07:26.110 || 00:07:26.120 || under the mattress in countries like
00:07:28.969 || 00:07:28.979 || Venezuela Argentina Brazil all
00:07:31.730 || 00:07:31.740 || throughout South America that will
00:07:34.670 || 00:07:34.680 || impact as well on inflation but apart
00:07:38.390 || 00:07:38.400 || from just physical dollar notes uh the
00:07:40.070 || 00:07:40.080 || fact that uh
00:07:43.070 || 00:07:43.080 || yeah interest rates are probably going
00:07:45.589 || 00:07:45.599 || to stay elevated because there won't be
00:07:48.589 || 00:07:48.599 || as much buying of bonds as well that's
00:07:50.990 || 00:07:51.000 || going to keep uh financing costs High
00:07:54.650 || 00:07:54.660 || that's probably gonna increase the U.S
00:07:56.870 || 00:07:56.880 || government's uh
00:07:59.210 || 00:07:59.220 || financing costs like every year they
00:08:02.450 || 00:08:02.460 || have to to renew uh old debt that
00:08:04.550 || 00:08:04.560 || matures how do they do that they don't
00:08:06.529 || 00:08:06.539 || pay it off well they pay it off by
00:08:08.689 || 00:08:08.699 || issuing more debt and it's going to keep
00:08:12.610 || 00:08:12.620 || costing more so it's a vicious circle
00:08:16.189 || 00:08:16.199 || instead of a of a virtuous circle that
00:08:19.129 || 00:08:19.139 || we've had for about 40 years where the
00:08:21.890 || 00:08:21.900 || Uncle Sam didn't have to worry about the
00:08:24.589 || 00:08:24.599 || debt because foreigners were captive
00:08:27.830 || 00:08:27.840 || buyers but uh I'm not saying foreigners
00:08:29.450 || 00:08:29.460 || are going to stop buying treasuries
00:08:32.089 || 00:08:32.099 || outright but uh I think there will be a
00:08:35.029 || 00:08:35.039 || huge decrease of uh the amount of
00:08:37.310 || 00:08:37.320 || treasuries they uh will need and we've
00:08:40.430 || 00:08:40.440 || seen already this year even Japan has uh
00:08:43.430 || 00:08:43.440 || lowered its treasury reserves like from
00:08:46.550 || 00:08:46.560 || like 1.3 trillion to just over a
00:08:49.550 || 00:08:49.560 || trillion China as well is now below I
00:08:52.009 || 00:08:52.019 || think approaching 900 billion from above
00:08:55.970 || 00:08:55.980 || uh I think from a above 1.1 trillion at
00:08:57.829 || 00:08:57.839 || the beginning of the year you can find
00:09:01.130 || 00:09:01.140 || that data at the U.S treasury website
00:09:04.430 || 00:09:04.440 || it's called the TIC The Tick data now
00:09:05.690 || 00:09:05.700 || what about Central Bank digital
00:09:07.250 || 00:09:07.260 || currencies because we're hearing a lot
00:09:09.590 || 00:09:09.600 || about this as well and many people out
00:09:10.910 || 00:09:10.920 || there are saying well that that's the
00:09:13.550 || 00:09:13.560 || future right whether it's good or bad
00:09:15.889 || 00:09:15.899 || um we're hearing in the U.S that they're
00:09:17.269 || 00:09:17.279 || rolling out the digital dollar it's
00:09:20.750 || 00:09:20.760 || already being tested right now so does
00:09:22.850 || 00:09:22.860 || that play a role in this at all or is it
00:09:24.949 || 00:09:24.959 || just that people are gonna countries are
00:09:28.130 || 00:09:28.140 || gonna move towards a sound money system
00:09:30.710 || 00:09:30.720 || yeah it's difficult to say uh whether
00:09:35.509 || 00:09:35.519 || this uh cbdc move is more just of a
00:09:38.150 || 00:09:38.160 || technological thing for among central
00:09:41.210 || 00:09:41.220 || banks to pay each other and Banks or if
00:09:43.310 || 00:09:43.320 || they really want to use it as well to
00:09:45.889 || 00:09:45.899 || keep track of what we do
00:09:46.509 || 00:09:46.519 || um
00:09:49.370 || 00:09:49.380 || and I I know people are worried about
00:09:53.810 || 00:09:53.820 || that and I think that is a worry but I
00:09:58.190 || 00:09:58.200 || think we need to be a little less
00:10:02.389 || 00:10:02.399 || um fearful about cbdc uh but uh yeah
00:10:04.610 || 00:10:04.620 || it's something that could also run
00:10:07.190 || 00:10:07.200 || parallel to the the system we have now
00:10:11.449 || 00:10:11.459 || of uh paper money and also we have a
00:10:13.610 || 00:10:13.620 || digital system right now wiring money
00:10:16.730 || 00:10:16.740 || and the debit cards and prepaid cards or
00:10:18.170 || 00:10:18.180 || credit cards
00:10:22.190 || 00:10:22.200 || so it could be uh technological thing
00:10:26.810 || 00:10:26.820 || and actually today I saw a story that
00:10:30.290 || 00:10:30.300 || came out of someone sent to me it's uh
00:10:32.990 || 00:10:33.000 || spur bank is the biggest bank in Russia
00:10:35.810 || 00:10:35.820 || commercial private bank they they've
00:10:38.769 || 00:10:38.779 || developed a blockchain currency
00:10:41.210 || 00:10:41.220 || backed by gold
00:10:44.630 || 00:10:44.640 || so in that sense that would be a good
00:10:47.630 || 00:10:47.640 || thing if they the Russians eventually
00:10:51.889 || 00:10:51.899 || had a gold back cbdc I think that would
00:10:54.110 || 00:10:54.120 || work but uh
00:10:56.690 || 00:10:56.700 || a lot of people think that the cbdcs
00:10:58.430 || 00:10:58.440 || will come about
00:11:00.710 || 00:11:00.720 || after a collapse in the west a collapse
00:11:02.690 || 00:11:02.700 || of the currencies and they'll then
00:11:05.990 || 00:11:06.000 || they'll uh come they'll say that uh cbdc
00:11:09.230 || 00:11:09.240 || is a solution but unless the cbdc is
00:11:12.470 || 00:11:12.480 || backed by something concrete like gold
00:11:15.590 || 00:11:15.600 || or silver I I think it could work
00:11:18.949 || 00:11:18.959 || initially but then it it wouldn't last
00:11:22.069 || 00:11:22.079 || too long it's a little bit like a in
00:11:24.650 || 00:11:24.660 || France uh after the French Revolution
00:11:28.490 || 00:11:28.500 || they they issued the asinyatz and that
00:11:29.870 || 00:11:29.880 || collapsed
00:11:33.170 || 00:11:33.180 || um you know that went uh inflated was
00:11:35.090 || 00:11:35.100 || inflated massively and collapsed and
00:11:38.329 || 00:11:38.339 || then they brought something else after
00:11:40.550 || 00:11:40.560 || the astronaut called the mandat and that
00:11:44.569 || 00:11:44.579 || didn't last very long either so cbdc uh
00:11:46.370 || 00:11:46.380 || yeah
00:11:49.730 || 00:11:49.740 || it is a worry but uh I think we need to
00:11:54.530 || 00:11:54.540 || uh maybe not be so fearful but again I I
00:11:57.590 || 00:11:57.600 || think one way to fight a cbdc uh the
00:12:02.210 || 00:12:02.220 || system is to have a monetary assets
00:12:04.970 || 00:12:04.980 || outside the banking system and you know
00:12:07.250 || 00:12:07.260 || we know what that is physical gold and
00:12:10.490 || 00:12:10.500 || silver and uh even if we have to use
00:12:13.130 || 00:12:13.140 || cbdc's uh I don't think it would be that
00:12:15.410 || 00:12:15.420 || different from what we use today
00:12:18.949 || 00:12:18.959 || digitally yes some people are concerned
00:12:21.230 || 00:12:21.240 || that they might program it they might
00:12:24.889 || 00:12:24.899 || put like a a sell-by date for the
00:12:28.250 || 00:12:28.260 || currency to make you spend uh quicker if
00:12:30.650 || 00:12:30.660 || the economy slows down and vice versa
00:12:33.050 || 00:12:33.060 || who knows but uh
00:12:36.650 || 00:12:36.660 || yeah I think yeah but there is a lot of
00:12:38.870 || 00:12:38.880 || uh talk about cbdc's that I have to
00:12:41.750 || 00:12:41.760 || admit now it seems like to me whether we
00:12:42.949 || 00:12:42.959 || have a central bank digital currency
00:12:45.350 || 00:12:45.360 || backed by gold or just a reserve
00:12:48.290 || 00:12:48.300 || currency from the brics backed by gold
00:12:50.150 || 00:12:50.160 || um you know the old saying that good
00:12:52.069 || 00:12:52.079 || money good money drives out bad money
00:12:54.530 || 00:12:54.540 || right so it seems to me that if we do
00:12:57.410 || 00:12:57.420 || have if any country goes to a gold back
00:12:59.990 || 00:13:00.000 || system it seems like that's kind of
00:13:01.730 || 00:13:01.740 || where the game ends or the game is over
00:13:03.949 || 00:13:03.959 || at that point because
00:13:06.110 || 00:13:06.120 || um who will want to hold dollars at that
00:13:09.290 || 00:13:09.300 || point if there's a gold back currency it
00:13:10.610 || 00:13:10.620 || seems like that would just be the
00:13:12.829 || 00:13:12.839 || currency that everyone would want yeah
00:13:15.650 || 00:13:15.660 || and I think that's why we're having such
00:13:16.690 || 00:13:16.700 || uh
00:13:21.170 || 00:13:21.180 || tumultuous geopolitical uh environment
00:13:22.329 || 00:13:22.339 || right now
00:13:26.750 || 00:13:26.760 || this uh proxy war in in the Ukraine and
00:13:29.750 || 00:13:29.760 || the fact that uh it doesn't look like uh
00:13:32.629 || 00:13:32.639 || the West I I think the Russians said
00:13:34.970 || 00:13:34.980 || they they're ready to negotiate but uh
00:13:37.310 || 00:13:37.320 || the terms that Ukraine and the West are
00:13:40.490 || 00:13:40.500 || giving Russia are unacceptable uh to the
00:13:44.629 || 00:13:44.639 || Russians so yes uh and I think it's got
00:13:48.470 || 00:13:48.480 || a lot to do with the brics uh currency
00:13:51.230 || 00:13:51.240 || what's going on uh in terms of the
00:13:54.829 || 00:13:54.839 || geopolitics even though we don't hear
00:13:57.470 || 00:13:57.480 || that in the mainstream media so you're
00:13:58.250 || 00:13:58.260 || right
00:13:58.910 || 00:13:58.920 || um
00:14:01.490 || 00:14:01.500 || I think I heard someone say years ago it
00:14:03.530 || 00:14:03.540 || could have been Jim Sinclair or someone
00:14:07.670 || 00:14:07.680 || else that once a Country Strong Enough
00:14:10.730 || 00:14:10.740 || like Russia and China let's say both
00:14:13.430 || 00:14:13.440 || together say we're gonna have a a gold
00:14:16.670 || 00:14:16.680 || back digital currency
00:14:20.389 || 00:14:20.399 || um yeah that we can trade through the
00:14:22.550 || 00:14:22.560 || blockchain yeah the dollar is going to
00:14:25.490 || 00:14:25.500 || be toast and I think that's why there's
00:14:28.790 || 00:14:28.800 || so much uh yeah there's so much buildup
00:14:31.910 || 00:14:31.920 || of tension right now uh
00:14:34.550 || 00:14:34.560 || between the West under the U.S
00:14:37.430 || 00:14:37.440 || leadership and the rest of the world the
00:14:40.610 || 00:14:40.620 || brics world now when it comes to how
00:14:42.230 || 00:14:42.240 || this is going to be impacting the prices
00:14:44.569 || 00:14:44.579 || of precious metals what I've heard
00:14:46.790 || 00:14:46.800 || before is that really for a gold
00:14:49.310 || 00:14:49.320 || standard today there's not enough gold
00:14:51.290 || 00:14:51.300 || out there at current prices so it seems
00:14:52.730 || 00:14:52.740 || like Precious Metals would have to be
00:14:54.889 || 00:14:54.899 || revalued to be able to have any
00:14:57.650 || 00:14:57.660 || substantial backing of a currency
00:14:59.810 || 00:14:59.820 || um do you agree with that yeah I think
00:15:01.850 || 00:15:01.860 || there's always enough gold and like you
00:15:03.829 || 00:15:03.839 || said it depends of the exchange rate
00:15:06.889 || 00:15:06.899 || because that's what we have to look at
00:15:10.990 || 00:15:11.000 || gold as the center of the monetary world
00:15:14.509 || 00:15:14.519 || so the currencies yeah it just depends
00:15:18.710 || 00:15:18.720 || on the ratio and uh yeah the price
00:15:21.590 || 00:15:21.600 || will be in Fiat terms will have to be a
00:15:23.930 || 00:15:23.940 || lot higher than it is now to to let's
00:15:27.530 || 00:15:27.540 || say get a 30 percent backing at least I
00:15:31.069 || 00:15:31.079 || think uh back in the 1900s under the
00:15:33.829 || 00:15:33.839 || classical gold standard uh the British
00:15:37.670 || 00:15:37.680 || had like a third backing for their uh
00:15:39.650 || 00:15:39.660 || currency and gold and that worked quite
00:15:41.269 || 00:15:41.279 || well
00:15:43.069 || 00:15:43.079 || um I mean some people would argue that
00:15:45.170 || 00:15:45.180 || they want a hundred percent backing but
00:15:48.530 || 00:15:48.540 || uh I think if you have 30 to 40 that
00:15:50.210 || 00:15:50.220 || would be enough
00:15:53.389 || 00:15:53.399 || to keep it uh keep it going
00:15:55.189 || 00:15:55.199 || and what impact do you think that'll
00:15:57.050 || 00:15:57.060 || have on the medals prices
00:15:59.449 || 00:15:59.459 || um do they have to be multiples of what
00:16:00.470 || 00:16:00.480 || they are today
00:16:03.410 || 00:16:03.420 || yeah I would say so yeah I I don't have
00:16:05.569 || 00:16:05.579 || a some people talk about
00:16:09.170 || 00:16:09.180 || 80 000 I think it was um
00:16:12.829 || 00:16:12.839 || Bill Holter some people talk huge
00:16:16.189 || 00:16:16.199 || numbers uh I don't think uh yeah I don't
00:16:17.870 || 00:16:17.880 || think uh
00:16:20.509 || 00:16:20.519 || the fear price yeah it is important
00:16:21.769 || 00:16:21.779 || right now but
00:16:24.350 || 00:16:24.360 || I think you will what will be important
00:16:27.829 || 00:16:27.839 || is the uh purchasing power of a gram of
00:16:30.530 || 00:16:30.540 || gold or an ounce of gold and silver I
00:16:32.750 || 00:16:32.760 || think it will be a lot higher than what
00:16:35.629 || 00:16:35.639 || it is now and uh yeah I guess that will
00:16:37.550 || 00:16:37.560 || be reflected uh
00:16:39.430 || 00:16:39.440 || in the Fiat price
00:16:42.110 || 00:16:42.120 || even though like in countries like
00:16:45.650 || 00:16:45.660 || Venezuela and Argentina and Lebanon and
00:16:48.110 || 00:16:48.120 || the currencies there have dropped so
00:16:51.350 || 00:16:51.360 || much that you can't even get gold with
00:16:54.230 || 00:16:54.240 || their their currencies so that's why I
00:16:55.970 || 00:16:55.980 || think it's important to focus on the
00:16:59.329 || 00:16:59.339 || purchasing power of gold and silver and
00:17:02.329 || 00:17:02.339 || when it comes to Silver I'm not hearing
00:17:05.390 || 00:17:05.400 || a lot about silver being used in this
00:17:07.370 || 00:17:07.380 || new monetary system if we if we go to
00:17:08.449 || 00:17:08.459 || this
00:17:11.150 || 00:17:11.160 || um do you think silver has any role in
00:17:13.549 || 00:17:13.559 || the monetary system of the future I
00:17:16.370 || 00:17:16.380 || think it should really yeah because it
00:17:20.210 || 00:17:20.220 || provides more liquidity because if you
00:17:24.350 || 00:17:24.360 || look back at the 1900s sorry 18 19th
00:17:28.130 || 00:17:28.140 || century 1800s up to World War one uh
00:17:31.730 || 00:17:31.740 || silver uh and gold were
00:17:33.890 || 00:17:33.900 || changing you know Changing Hands there
00:17:37.070 || 00:17:37.080 || were both currencies and uh gold is more
00:17:41.390 || 00:17:41.400 || of a savings instrument more for you
00:17:43.789 || 00:17:43.799 || could argue like for your saving
00:17:47.090 || 00:17:47.100 || wealth's uh wealth uh preservation and
00:17:49.370 || 00:17:49.380 || storage and silver is more of a change
00:17:53.330 || 00:17:53.340 || currency so I I think uh yeah I think it
00:17:56.270 || 00:17:56.280 || should come back whether it will I don't
00:17:58.850 || 00:17:58.860 || know but uh we've seen that the Indians
00:18:00.770 || 00:18:00.780 || have been buying a lot of silver and I
00:18:03.650 || 00:18:03.660 || think a few years ago even the Russian
00:18:05.810 || 00:18:05.820 || Central Bank bought silver so I think
00:18:08.870 || 00:18:08.880 || they have silver uh and the Chinese I
00:18:10.909 || 00:18:10.919 || think they have a lot of silver the
00:18:14.150 || 00:18:14.160 || Chinese people so who knows it's
00:18:16.789 || 00:18:16.799 || possible you have Mexico as well they
00:18:20.029 || 00:18:20.039 || they could go on a dual uh gold and
00:18:21.650 || 00:18:21.660 || silver standard I think it would be good
00:18:24.490 || 00:18:24.500 || because as I said it provides more
00:18:29.090 || 00:18:29.100 || options not just gold but also a silver
00:18:31.909 || 00:18:31.919 || and speaking of that optionality the
00:18:34.130 || 00:18:34.140 || central banks that are accumulating gold
00:18:36.830 || 00:18:36.840 || right now do have more
00:18:39.230 || 00:18:39.240 || um I guess more soundness right than
00:18:41.390 || 00:18:41.400 || those that don't you mentioned in a
00:18:43.430 || 00:18:43.440 || recent video that central banks can
00:18:45.950 || 00:18:45.960 || actually use gold to re-liquify their
00:18:47.270 || 00:18:47.280 || balance sheets
00:18:49.070 || 00:18:49.080 || um can you expand on that and kind of
00:18:52.250 || 00:18:52.260 || the power that gold gives central banks
00:18:56.090 || 00:18:56.100 || yeah I think it was one of the uh
00:18:58.549 || 00:18:58.559 || Central Bankers in Europe a few weeks
00:19:02.210 || 00:19:02.220 || ago or months the head of the Dutch
00:19:05.330 || 00:19:05.340 || Central Bank uh he was uh doing an
00:19:08.029 || 00:19:08.039 || interview on TV over there and the
00:19:09.830 || 00:19:09.840 || central bank's balance sheets now are
00:19:12.289 || 00:19:12.299 || underwater because all the bond prices
00:19:14.510 || 00:19:14.520 || are dropping and they did a lot of QE
00:19:17.090 || 00:19:17.100 || and they have very thin uh amount of
00:19:20.390 || 00:19:20.400 || capital and this guy uh I think his name
00:19:21.610 || 00:19:21.620 || is not
00:19:25.070 || 00:19:25.080 || k-n-o-t he said that we could always use
00:19:28.789 || 00:19:28.799 || gold to uh you know re-liquify our
00:19:31.850 || 00:19:31.860 || balance sheet because yeah a lot of
00:19:35.870 || 00:19:35.880 || central banks have have gold and uh
00:19:38.450 || 00:19:38.460 || and how would they do that well I think
00:19:40.430 || 00:19:40.440 || they would instruct the bullion Banks
00:19:43.490 || 00:19:43.500 || which really uh are agents of the
00:19:45.890 || 00:19:45.900 || central banks to close their paper
00:19:47.029 || 00:19:47.039 || shorts
00:19:49.430 || 00:19:49.440 || you know and that would drive the price
00:19:53.690 || 00:19:53.700 || up and it would re revalue their uh
00:19:57.830 || 00:19:57.840 || their balance sheet and uh with uh
00:19:59.750 || 00:19:59.760 || with the environment and the bond market
00:20:02.990 || 00:20:03.000 || and the way I see it it it's very
00:20:05.150 || 00:20:05.160 || possible to happen in the future I think
00:20:08.630 || 00:20:08.640 || in 1980 when gold went almost up to 900
00:20:12.710 || 00:20:12.720 || the fed's balance sheet was backed by
00:20:15.890 || 00:20:15.900 || over a hundred percent like 125 percent
00:20:18.409 || 00:20:18.419 || by gold so
00:20:20.150 || 00:20:20.160 || um that you know the market did that
00:20:23.690 || 00:20:23.700 || when gold went from 400 like in the
00:20:28.310 || 00:20:28.320 || beginning of the of 1979 to 800 and 70
00:20:33.230 || 00:20:33.240 || or 887 in in January 1980 so yet the
00:20:34.549 || 00:20:34.559 || market could do it
00:20:36.650 || 00:20:36.660 || or they could
00:20:38.450 || 00:20:38.460 || I don't think they would do it
00:20:41.890 || 00:20:41.900 || officially because uh gold that would uh
00:20:45.590 || 00:20:45.600 || imply that gold is now running things
00:20:48.169 || 00:20:48.179 || they would probably let the market do it
00:20:50.690 || 00:20:50.700 || they would you know as I said bullying
00:20:52.909 || 00:20:52.919 || Banks would cover their paper shorts
00:20:57.470 || 00:20:57.480 || which are huge as we as we know and that
00:21:01.010 || 00:21:01.020 || would catapult the price higher and then
00:21:05.210 || 00:21:05.220 || they would just uh probably say oh gold
00:21:07.549 || 00:21:07.559 || is now going to be in a band and they
00:21:09.830 || 00:21:09.840 || will sell you know at a certain price
00:21:12.890 || 00:21:12.900 || and buy at a certain price and keep it
00:21:13.789 || 00:21:13.799 || there
00:21:15.770 || 00:21:15.780 || you know when it comes to Central Bank
00:21:18.409 || 00:21:18.419 || credibility it seems like that in this
00:21:20.390 || 00:21:20.400 || new system well in the current system
00:21:23.810 || 00:21:23.820 || we're in all the markets are looking at
00:21:26.990 || 00:21:27.000 || what the FED says you know Powell speaks
00:21:29.690 || 00:21:29.700 || in the the market moves right in this
00:21:32.870 || 00:21:32.880 || new system do you see the FED uh the U.S
00:21:34.310 || 00:21:34.320 || Central Bank really having much
00:21:37.549 || 00:21:37.559 || importance if if you know the the really
00:21:39.230 || 00:21:39.240 || important currency is really you know
00:21:41.690 || 00:21:41.700 || what the what the brics Nations have
00:21:44.210 || 00:21:44.220 || because it's gold-backed do you see
00:21:46.310 || 00:21:46.320 || um the FED having much credibility or
00:21:48.770 || 00:21:48.780 || importance in that new system well I
00:21:50.750 || 00:21:50.760 || don't think they have credibility right
00:21:54.169 || 00:21:54.179 || now but uh because I actually think the
00:21:56.450 || 00:21:56.460 || market the fed's been behind the curve
00:22:00.350 || 00:22:00.360 || but yeah it will depend how the fed and
00:22:03.590 || 00:22:03.600 || the Western central banks react to a a
00:22:05.110 || 00:22:05.120 || potential
00:22:09.289 || 00:22:09.299 || bricks gold Bank currency but uh yes in
00:22:10.870 || 00:22:10.880 || a gold back system
00:22:13.610 || 00:22:13.620 || the the central bank is there just to
00:22:17.630 || 00:22:17.640 || like uh facilitate I would say payments
00:22:20.630 || 00:22:20.640 || like between amongst Nations you know if
00:22:23.090 || 00:22:23.100 || you have a surplus one year
00:22:26.690 || 00:22:26.700 || um you will send uh let's say paper you
00:22:31.730 || 00:22:31.740 || want to to Moscow and uh and then the
00:22:34.010 || 00:22:34.020 || the Russian Central Bank will send the
00:22:36.169 || 00:22:36.179 || Chinese some gold that that's what it's
00:22:39.049 || 00:22:39.059 || there for so yeah
00:22:42.350 || 00:22:42.360 || whether that will happen in the west uh
00:22:46.370 || 00:22:46.380 || it's difficult to say ideally you know
00:22:48.350 || 00:22:48.360 || when we should be in a world where
00:22:51.250 || 00:22:51.260 || central if there are to be central banks
00:22:54.649 || 00:22:54.659 || they're just like depositories of uh
00:22:56.270 || 00:22:56.280 || currency and gold
00:23:00.049 || 00:23:00.059 || uh but uh and then the market the market
00:23:03.049 || 00:23:03.059 || individuals in the market decide what
00:23:06.649 || 00:23:06.659 || the price of credit is by either uh
00:23:09.110 || 00:23:09.120 || lending their gold which means putting
00:23:11.330 || 00:23:11.340 || your gold with the bank or withdrawing
00:23:13.970 || 00:23:13.980 || it you know that changes interest rates
00:23:18.409 || 00:23:18.419 || so yeah I think we we might go back to
00:23:20.870 || 00:23:20.880 || that kind of world because we've had
00:23:24.710 || 00:23:24.720 || this uh crazy floating rate currency and
00:23:26.090 || 00:23:26.100 || uh
00:23:29.270 || 00:23:29.280 || fiat currency system for too long and uh
00:23:31.909 || 00:23:31.919 || the flip side of that would be people
00:23:34.250 || 00:23:34.260 || would actually probably think oh this is
00:23:36.529 || 00:23:36.539 || not a free market system because uh
00:23:38.570 || 00:23:38.580 || currencies are are not floating anymore
00:23:41.270 || 00:23:41.280 || but if you think about it uh currencies
00:23:44.510 || 00:23:44.520 || and money is just a should be a measure
00:23:47.930 || 00:23:47.940 || of weight of gold and silver and I think
00:23:50.810 || 00:23:50.820 || that was a big mistake uh Milton
00:23:53.890 || 00:23:53.900 || Friedman made even though he was a
00:23:57.049 || 00:23:57.059 || pro-free market guy he said oh currency
00:23:58.970 || 00:23:58.980 || should float it's a free market but I
00:24:01.010 || 00:24:01.020 || think that's wrong before unless you go
00:24:02.510 || 00:24:02.520 || Mario if we could get your perspective
00:24:04.070 || 00:24:04.080 || kind of on the shorter term we've been
00:24:06.230 || 00:24:06.240 || focusing more on the big picture right
00:24:08.149 || 00:24:08.159 || now in the system that we're heading
00:24:10.250 || 00:24:10.260 || into it looks like but if we're looking
00:24:11.690 || 00:24:11.700 || you know we're looking at the end of the
00:24:13.730 || 00:24:13.740 || year coming up in a few days here in a
00:24:16.970 || 00:24:16.980 || New Year 2023 what do you anticipate for
00:24:18.890 || 00:24:18.900 || the precious metals in this coming year
00:24:22.750 || 00:24:22.760 || yeah I mean up until a few months ago
00:24:25.090 || 00:24:25.100 || precious metals were
00:24:27.470 || 00:24:27.480 || disappointing and I would say I guess
00:24:28.669 || 00:24:28.679 || they are still a little bit
00:24:31.490 || 00:24:31.500 || disappointing especially if you uh in in
00:24:34.250 || 00:24:34.260 || the US and you uh your currency is the
00:24:36.830 || 00:24:36.840 || US dollar I think gold is
00:24:39.350 || 00:24:39.360 || pretty much unchanged for the year which
00:24:41.870 || 00:24:41.880 || is better than being down like over 30
00:24:44.990 || 00:24:45.000 || percent like the NASDAQ and uh better
00:24:47.450 || 00:24:47.460 || than being down over I think almost 30
00:24:50.870 || 00:24:50.880 || percent in the TLT which is a long-term
00:24:54.830 || 00:24:54.840 || uh treasury ETF as well and silver I
00:24:56.990 || 00:24:57.000 || mean it's picked up it's up on the year
00:25:01.130 || 00:25:01.140 || now about three percent and uh
00:25:03.710 || 00:25:03.720 || it's been a year where central banks
00:25:07.010 || 00:25:07.020 || have really been aggressive with their
00:25:10.870 || 00:25:10.880 || tightening with QT especially the fed
00:25:13.490 || 00:25:13.500 || and that all those people who said oh
00:25:15.230 || 00:25:15.240 || when interest rates go up gold and
00:25:17.810 || 00:25:17.820 || silver are going to collapse and they've
00:25:21.529 || 00:25:21.539 || actually stood really firm so my view is
00:25:25.190 || 00:25:25.200 || that the fed and other central banks yes
00:25:27.769 || 00:25:27.779 || they probably keep tightening for the
00:25:30.529 || 00:25:30.539 || next few months maybe into the spring
00:25:32.210 || 00:25:32.220 || but after that they're going to slow
00:25:35.930 || 00:25:35.940 || down so I think that will put
00:25:36.769 || 00:25:36.779 || um
00:25:40.850 || 00:25:40.860 || uh you know win behind uh the the gold
00:25:43.370 || 00:25:43.380 || and silver sails and uh
00:25:46.430 || 00:25:46.440 || yeah I think it will be a good year for
00:25:49.789 || 00:25:49.799 || for gold and silver batter then um 2022
00:25:53.330 || 00:25:53.340 || and I don't think 22 2022 has been bad
00:25:55.130 || 00:25:55.140 || because if you look at all the other
00:25:57.470 || 00:25:57.480 || assets they they've lost so much if
00:26:00.529 || 00:26:00.539 || you've had gold and silver uh you can
00:26:02.409 || 00:26:02.419 || buy a lot of things a lot cheaper
00:26:06.289 || 00:26:06.299 || Bitcoin you can pay 60 less than you did
00:26:08.450 || 00:26:08.460 || at the beginning of the year for example
00:26:10.669 || 00:26:10.679 || you can buy bonds a lot cheaper as well
00:26:14.210 || 00:26:14.220 || and you can buy stocks uh am I saying
00:26:16.850 || 00:26:16.860 || people should do that not necessarily
00:26:19.850 || 00:26:19.860 || but uh yeah I think uh also the new
00:26:23.269 || 00:26:23.279 || bricks set up for their uh currency is
00:26:26.029 || 00:26:26.039 || going to be more commodity based and I I
00:26:27.830 || 00:26:27.840 || think uh not just gold and silver are
00:26:29.690 || 00:26:29.700 || going to do well but Commodities are
00:26:31.970 || 00:26:31.980 || going to continue to do well too all
00:26:33.470 || 00:26:33.480 || right well Mario we really appreciate
