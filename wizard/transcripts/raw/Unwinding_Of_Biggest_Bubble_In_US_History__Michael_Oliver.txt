00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
in both markets but your question was is
 

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.110 align:start position:0%
in both markets but your question was is
there<00:10:27.899><c> potential</c><00:10:28.260><c> for</c><00:10:28.440><c> pullback</c><00:10:28.860><c> yes</c>

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
there potential for pullback yes
 

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.590 align:start position:0%
there potential for pullback yes
uh<00:10:31.320><c> we</c><00:10:31.920><c> see</c><00:10:32.160><c> potential</c><00:10:32.820><c> sometime</c><00:10:33.240><c> in</c><00:10:33.420><c> this</c>

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh we see potential sometime in this
 

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.269 align:start position:0%
uh we see potential sometime in this
quarter<00:10:33.899><c> maybe</c><00:10:34.140><c> to</c><00:10:34.380><c> have</c><00:10:34.560><c> silver</c><00:10:34.740><c> drop</c><00:10:35.040><c> back</c>

00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
quarter maybe to have silver drop back
 

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:37.430 align:start position:0%
quarter maybe to have silver drop back
down<00:10:35.459><c> in</c><00:10:35.700><c> the</c><00:10:35.880><c> lower</c><00:10:36.060><c> 23s</c><00:10:36.720><c> again</c><00:10:36.899><c> which</c><00:10:37.140><c> is</c><00:10:37.260><c> to</c>

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
down in the lower 23s again which is to
 

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.170 align:start position:0%
down in the lower 23s again which is to
say<00:10:37.620><c> drop</c><00:10:37.860><c> three</c><00:10:38.160><c> percent</c><00:10:38.399><c> from</c><00:10:38.700><c> where</c><00:10:38.880><c> it</c><00:10:39.000><c> is</c>

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
say drop three percent from where it is
 

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.070 align:start position:0%
say drop three percent from where it is
right<00:10:39.360><c> now</c>

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
right now
 

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.110 align:start position:0%
right now
we<00:10:40.560><c> see</c><00:10:40.800><c> the</c><00:10:41.040><c> potential</c><00:10:41.339><c> for</c><00:10:41.580><c> gold</c><00:10:41.760><c> to</c><00:10:41.940><c> maybe</c>

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
we see the potential for gold to maybe
 

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.730 align:start position:0%
we see the potential for gold to maybe
drop<00:10:42.360><c> a</c><00:10:42.600><c> couple</c><00:10:42.720><c> percent</c><00:10:43.019><c> from</c><00:10:43.320><c> where</c><00:10:43.500><c> it</c><00:10:43.620><c> is</c>

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:43.740 align:start position:0%
drop a couple percent from where it is
 

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.050 align:start position:0%
drop a couple percent from where it is
right<00:10:44.040><c> now</c>

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
right now
 

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.870 align:start position:0%
right now
but<00:10:45.540><c> that's</c><00:10:45.779><c> about</c><00:10:45.959><c> it</c>

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
but that's about it
 

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.690 align:start position:0%
but that's about it
um<00:10:48.000><c> so</c><00:10:48.839><c> we</c><00:10:49.019><c> do</c><00:10:49.140><c> see</c><00:10:49.380><c> the</c><00:10:49.560><c> potential</c><00:10:49.860><c> always</c><00:10:50.160><c> for</c>

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:50.700 align:start position:0%
um so we do see the potential always for
 

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.030 align:start position:0%
um so we do see the potential always for
counter<00:10:51.120><c> Trend</c><00:10:51.360><c> moves</c><00:10:51.720><c> but</c><00:10:51.899><c> you</c><00:10:52.140><c> we</c><00:10:52.560><c> think</c><00:10:52.800><c> you</c>

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
counter Trend moves but you we think you
 

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.730 align:start position:0%
counter Trend moves but you we think you
should<00:10:53.279><c> basically</c><00:10:54.019><c> ignore</c><00:10:55.019><c> those</c><00:10:55.260><c> if</c><00:10:55.620><c> you're</c>

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
should basically ignore those if you're
 

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.050 align:start position:0%
should basically ignore those if you're
an<00:10:55.860><c> investor</c>

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
an investor
 

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.490 align:start position:0%
an investor
you<00:10:57.480><c> should</c><00:10:57.540><c> be</c><00:10:57.720><c> looking</c><00:10:57.839><c> at</c><00:10:58.019><c> the</c><00:10:58.200><c> larger</c>

00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
you should be looking at the larger
 

00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.630 align:start position:0%
you should be looking at the larger
context

00:10:59.630 --> 00:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
context
 

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.790 align:start position:0%

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
and as far as we're concerned if one's
 

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.829 align:start position:0%
and as far as we're concerned if one's
in<00:11:01.980><c> those</c><00:11:02.100><c> markets</c><00:11:02.579><c> you</c><00:11:02.700><c> should</c><00:11:02.880><c> be</c><00:11:03.060><c> in</c><00:11:03.240><c> now</c>

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
in those markets you should be in now
 

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:06.710 align:start position:0%
in those markets you should be in now
okay<00:11:04.459><c> and</c><00:11:05.459><c> there's</c><00:11:05.700><c> one</c><00:11:05.940><c> more</c><00:11:06.060><c> tier</c><00:11:06.420><c> that</c>

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
okay and there's one more tier that
 

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.150 align:start position:0%
okay and there's one more tier that
we've<00:11:06.899><c> got</c><00:11:07.019><c> to</c><00:11:07.140><c> break</c><00:11:07.320><c> through</c><00:11:07.500><c> once</c><00:11:07.920><c> we</c><00:11:08.040><c> break</c>

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
we've got to break through once we break
 

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.889 align:start position:0%
we've got to break through once we break
through<00:11:08.399><c> that</c><00:11:08.579><c> we</c><00:11:08.820><c> think</c><00:11:08.940><c> that's</c><00:11:09.180><c> it</c><00:11:09.420><c> that's</c>

00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:09.899 align:start position:0%
through that we think that's it that's
 

00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:12.410 align:start position:0%
through that we think that's it that's
the<00:11:10.140><c> final</c><00:11:10.260><c> green</c><00:11:10.560><c> light</c><00:11:10.800><c> and</c><00:11:11.700><c> we'll</c><00:11:11.940><c> that</c>

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
the final green light and we'll that
 

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.230 align:start position:0%
the final green light and we'll that
will<00:11:12.600><c> be</c><00:11:12.779><c> in</c><00:11:12.839><c> our</c><00:11:13.019><c> reports</c>

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
will be in our reports
 

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.150 align:start position:0%
will be in our reports
I<00:11:15.779><c> think</c><00:11:15.899><c> it</c><00:11:16.140><c> might</c><00:11:16.320><c> be</c><00:11:16.440><c> a</c><00:11:16.740><c> bit</c><00:11:16.860><c> difficult</c>

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
I think it might be a bit difficult
 

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.710 align:start position:0%
I think it might be a bit difficult
right<00:11:17.459><c> now</c><00:11:17.579><c> if</c><00:11:17.820><c> we're</c><00:11:17.940><c> you</c><00:11:18.180><c> know</c><00:11:18.300><c> looking</c><00:11:18.420><c> at</c>

like

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:32.220 align:start position:0%
like
 

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.009 align:start position:0%
like
um what<00:11:32.579><c> you're</c><00:11:32.700><c> saying</c><00:11:33.060><c> is</c><00:11:33.240><c> the</c><00:11:33.540><c> trend</c><00:11:33.779><c> has</c>

00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:34.019 align:start position:0%
um what you're saying is the trend has
 

00:11:34.019 --> 00:11:35.990 align:start position:0%
um what you're saying is the trend has
started<00:11:34.380><c> we</c><00:11:34.680><c> might</c><00:11:34.800><c> see</c><00:11:35.040><c> a</c><00:11:35.220><c> bit</c><00:11:35.279><c> of</c><00:11:35.399><c> a</c><00:11:35.519><c> dip</c><00:11:35.760><c> but</c>

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
started we might see a bit of a dip but
 

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.930 align:start position:0%
started we might see a bit of a dip but
really<00:11:36.240><c> it</c><00:11:37.019><c> in</c><00:11:37.440><c> your</c><00:11:37.560><c> perspective</c><00:11:38.040><c> it's</c><00:11:38.279><c> up</c><00:11:38.640><c> up</c>

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
really it in your perspective it's up up

really it in your perspective it's up up
from<00:11:39.180><c> here</c>

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
from here

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
like three or four tiers that we broke
 

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.490 align:start position:0%
