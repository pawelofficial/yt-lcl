these at these levels in these charts so
 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.170 align:start position:0%
these at these levels in these charts so

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
it's important for us to know what those

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.210 align:start position:0%
so what we drop down to a low the low
here<00:02:07.079><c> was</c><00:02:07.439><c> uh</c><00:02:08.060><c> 1740</c><00:02:09.060><c> on</c><00:02:09.479><c> Silver</c><00:02:09.720><c> and</c><00:02:10.619><c> the</c><00:02:10.979><c> big</c>

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
but what's really encouraging is that we
 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.910 align:start position:0%
but what's really encouraging is that we
rallied<00:03:57.420><c> back</c><00:03:57.599><c> above</c><00:03:57.900><c> it</c><00:03:58.019><c> and</c><00:03:58.620><c> some</c><00:03:58.799><c> people</c>

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
rallied back above it and some people
 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.770 align:start position:0%
rallied back above it and some people
might<00:03:59.159><c> call</c><00:03:59.280><c> that</c><00:03:59.459><c> a</c><00:03:59.580><c> false</c><00:03:59.879><c> breakdown</c><00:04:00.180><c> and</c>

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
might call that a false breakdown and
 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.330 align:start position:0%
might call that a false breakdown and
that's<00:04:00.959><c> actually</c><00:04:01.200><c> a</c><00:04:01.500><c> Buy</c><00:04:01.680><c> Signal</c><00:04:02.040><c> when</c>

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
that's actually a Buy Signal when
 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.550 align:start position:0%
that's actually a Buy Signal when
support<00:04:02.879><c> is</c><00:04:03.239><c> lost</c><00:04:03.480><c> but</c><00:04:03.900><c> it</c><00:04:04.080><c> doesn't</c><00:04:04.200><c> stay</c>

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
support is lost but it doesn't stay
 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.589 align:start position:0%
support is lost but it doesn't stay
there<00:04:04.739><c> and</c><00:04:05.099><c> then</c><00:04:05.280><c> it</c><00:04:05.400><c> reclaims</c><00:04:06.000><c> what</c><00:04:06.299><c> was</c>

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
there and then it reclaims what was
 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.710 align:start position:0%
there and then it reclaims what was
support<00:04:07.080><c> as</c><00:04:07.560><c> resistance</c><00:04:08.159><c> a</c><00:04:09.120><c> lot</c><00:04:09.180><c> of</c><00:04:09.299><c> traders</c>

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
support as resistance a lot of traders
 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.890 align:start position:0%
support as resistance a lot of traders
buy<00:04:10.560><c> that</c><00:04:10.799><c> breakout</c><00:04:11.220><c> back</c><00:04:11.700><c> above</c><00:04:12.120><c> what</c><00:04:12.420><c> was</c><00:04:12.659><c> uh</c>

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
buy that breakout back above what was uh
 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.570 align:start position:0%
buy that breakout back above what was uh
support<00:04:13.080><c> and</c><00:04:13.439><c> is</c><00:04:13.620><c> now</c><00:04:13.739><c> resistant</c><00:04:14.159><c> so</c><00:04:14.400><c> that's</c>

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
support and is now resistant so that's
 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.210 align:start position:0%
support and is now resistant so that's
1675<00:04:15.360><c> that</c><00:04:15.720><c> looks</c><00:04:16.199><c> to</c><00:04:16.440><c> me</c><00:04:16.620><c> like</c><00:04:16.799><c> a</c><00:04:16.979><c> false</c>

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
1675 that looks to me like a false
 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.469 align:start position:0%
1675 that looks to me like a false
breakdown

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
breakdown
 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.449 align:start position:0%
breakdown
um<00:04:18.540><c> I</c><00:04:18.660><c> think</c><00:04:18.959><c> that's</c><00:04:19.199><c> what's</c><00:04:19.500><c> most</c><00:04:19.919><c> the</c><00:04:20.280><c> most</c>

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 align:start position:0%
um I think that's what's most the most
 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.009 align:start position:0%
um I think that's what's most the most

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 align:start position:0%
likely scenario you do have this
 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.050 align:start position:0%

in the past that the downside for

upside potential for silver is that
 

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.850 align:start position:0%

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:49.860 align:start position:0%
still your view like what do you think
 

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.710 align:start position:0%
still your view like what do you think
the<00:09:50.040><c> downside</c><00:09:50.339><c> potential</c><00:09:50.820><c> is</c><00:09:51.000><c> versus</c><00:09:51.300><c> the</c>

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
the downside potential is versus the
 

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.150 align:start position:0%
the downside potential is versus the

potential upside that we're looking at
 

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.949 align:start position:0%
potential upside that we're looking at
right<00:09:53.339><c> now</c><00:09:53.519><c> yeah</c><00:09:54.060><c> I</c><00:09:54.240><c> think</c><00:09:54.360><c> that's</c><00:09:54.480><c> a</c><00:09:54.660><c> this</c><00:09:54.839><c> is</c>

00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
right now yeah I think that's a this is
 

00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:56.150 align:start position:0%
right now yeah I think that's a this is
a<00:09:55.019><c> great</c><00:09:55.140><c> way</c><00:09:55.320><c> to</c><00:09:55.440><c> think</c><00:09:55.560><c> about</c><00:09:55.680><c> it</c><00:09:55.860><c> if</c><00:09:56.040><c> you've</c>

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
a great way to think about it if you've
 

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.710 align:start position:0%
a great way to think about it if you've
got<00:09:56.279><c> a</c><00:09:56.459><c> one</c><00:09:56.580><c> plus</c><00:09:56.760><c> your</c><00:09:57.000><c> time</c><00:09:57.180><c> Horizon</c><00:09:57.420><c> and</c>

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
got a one plus your time Horizon and
 

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.329 align:start position:0%
got a one plus your time Horizon and
this<00:09:57.899><c> could</c><00:09:58.019><c> all</c><00:09:58.140><c> unfold</c><00:09:58.440><c> much</c><00:09:58.800><c> sooner</c><00:09:59.040><c> than</c><00:09:59.160><c> a</c>

00:09:59.329 --> 00:09:59.339 align:start position:0%
this could all unfold much sooner than a
 

00:09:59.339 --> 00:10:01.430 align:start position:0%
this could all unfold much sooner than a
year<00:09:59.459><c> let's</c><00:10:00.060><c> just</c><00:10:00.240><c> call</c><00:10:00.300><c> it</c><00:10:00.480><c> that</c>

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
year let's just call it that
 

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.630 align:start position:0%

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't really make sense at this moment
 

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.670 align:start position:0%

um now your perspective on that because
 

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.490 align:start position:0%
um now your perspective on that because

um we do see precious metals fall as
 

00:14:59.579 --> 00:15:01.790 align:start position:0%
um we do see precious metals fall as
well<00:14:59.820><c> but</c><00:15:00.360><c> then</c><00:15:00.480><c> they</c><00:15:00.720><c> reverse</c><00:15:01.199><c> usually</c>

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.730 align:start position:0%

um so first where do you see the stock
 

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:08.810 align:start position:0%
um so first where do you see the stock
market<00:15:07.019><c> heading</c><00:15:07.800><c> and</c><00:15:08.100><c> could</c><00:15:08.339><c> what</c><00:15:08.699><c> we're</c>

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.310 align:start position:0%
seeing right now in this precious metals
be<00:15:11.160><c> that</c><00:15:11.339><c> reversal</c><00:15:11.940><c> of</c><00:15:12.660><c> precious</c><00:15:13.019><c> metals</c>

00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
answer that question exactly because I
 

00:15:25.079 --> 00:15:26.990 align:start position:0%
answer that question exactly because I
can<00:15:25.199><c> easily</c><00:15:25.500><c> see</c><00:15:25.740><c> a</c><00:15:25.860><c> scenario</c><00:15:26.279><c> where</c><00:15:26.579><c> stocks</c>

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
can easily see a scenario where stocks
 

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.310 align:start position:0%
can easily see a scenario where stocks
